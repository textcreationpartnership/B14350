            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

So that, entrance is both wayes denied vnto the enimie.</p>
            <p>Moreouer while we see the gospel, cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually casting out suche huge heapes of Fome and Froth: wee learne, that it cānot be otherwise, but that our selues are to be cast out as scumme, vnles the Gospel shal find fauour with our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aswel as it hath entertainmēt with

And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel keepeth not all that come vnto her: can it be that we shold not godly feare aswell the daunger of our deuorcement from her: as nowe we are ashamed, not to be reputed as those, who bee betrothed vnto her: Now as the wicked (taking more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of life, and growing into a greater contempt of al duty, both vnto God and man, by being offēded at the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel for the breaking out of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse: whether in opinion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, who haue been brought vp some time in the bosome of the church:) therby doe euidently declare, that they are of the wicked: for vnto the good, all thinges fal out for their good: So do we by getting this gaine of these controuersies in religion, that therby we better both our iudgemēt,

Let our warines thē be so much the greater, and our paines so muche the more, as the times whereinto we be fallen, do tel vs how hard a matter it is, to keepe vs euen and vpright with our God: and how daungerous: whē we once be trusted with his Gospel, to deale vnfaithfully in our obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the same.</p>
            <p>The cause why I haue published this matter, is, for that he, who required my answeare to his Assertions did not vouchesafe for al that after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it, so much as once to reade it. Wherevpon diuers haue mooued me, to make that cōmon vnto moe, which founde so small fauour with him, for whose cause it was taken in hand, that seeing himself, would not geue any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casiō, to think my paines wel bestowed,

               <p>IT is an article of our Faith, to beleeue the Catholique Church, whose Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister is the holie Ghost, and therfore in the Creede that article is placed next to the article of the beliefe in the holye Ghost: by whose continuall instruction and assistance being directed,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> shee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre in matters of faith. For as saint Paul saith, she is <hi>Columna &amp; firmamentum veritatis:</hi> so that wee are all bounde her to beleeue and obaie, yea howsoeuer it seemeth to our sence &amp; vnderstanding.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <head>Aunswere.</head>
               <p>YOu affirme that we ought to beleeue the Catholique Churche. It is true. we ought to be most assured that the death of Christ was not fruitelesse, but that by it
<pb facs="tcp:176688:6"/> the Lord hath purchased a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnto him selfe, takinge them out of all places where it hath liked him, according to the good pleasure of his will: without bindinge of himselfe, and his grace vnto any particular person, countrie, or place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and this we ought to beleeue.</p>
               <p>Consider it wel therfore with your self, that the church is a matter that falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beliefe, in so much that good Christians harkeninge ouermuch vnto their reason &amp; sence, haue somtime iudged amisse therof: takinge it not to be, when notwithstādinge it is, or not there to be, where in trueth it is: stumbling at suche things, as sense &amp; reason are wont to be offended withal: as that the persons be often in number fewe, in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion base, in estimation contēptible, subiect vnto the iniurious dealings of the world: and therfore not onely not equall vnto the rest, but in the iudgement of sence &amp; reason muche inferior. So that necessarilie belief taketh place in the article of the Churche. And if this be true in particular churches, howe much more is the vse of faith requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Catholique &amp; vniuersal, church, which can not bee subiect to any man his
<pb facs="tcp:176688:6"/> sight. You affirme moreouer that the holy Ghost is scholemaister vnto the churche, &amp; that therefore this article touchinge the churche is placed next vnto that of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe in the holy Ghost. I doe admitte your gathering for there nere placing, &amp; I har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely pray you consider what can be said for the order of their standing. For albeit their places be nere togither, yet the article of our belief in the holy Ghost in order is the former, takinge the first place &amp; the vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hande of the other, wherby we are admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, that if any people claime the title of the Catholique church, we are not bound to beleeue them, before they make good proufe, that the holy Ghost hath bene their scholemaister. For they may not come into to the possession of the Catholique church, but by proufe, that the doctrine w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they hould, hath beene taught them by that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie teacher. And therefore let the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the holy Ghost bee perused, which are the canonical scriptures, as witnesseth <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in this woordes:<note place="margin">Chrysost. de Fide &amp; Lege Naturae.</note>
                  <hi>Omnia quaecunque vel Lex dicit, vel Prophetae vaticinantur, vel Apostoli praedicāt, Sācto spiritui verè tribuuntur &amp; ascribuntur:</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:176688:7"/> And if it shall appeare by them, that you haue beene taught of him, we will yeelde vnto you the title of the catholique church: But if you wil deuide the holy Ghost from the Scriptures, vrginge vs only with his bare name, and doe not warrant by the woord that, which you ascribe vnto him: we can not receiue such a spirit for holy Ghost: because we finde a graunt both of the Spirit and the woord, passed from the Lord vnto the Churche, to continewe for euer ioyntly togither.<note place="margin">Esay 59.21.</note>
                  <hi>Hoc foedus meum cū eis dicit Dominus: Spiritus meus qui est in te, &amp; verba mea quae posui in ore tuo, non rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, de ore tuo, &amp; de ore seminis tui, dicit Dominus, ex nunc &amp; vs{que} in sempiternum.</hi> This is my couenant with them, saith the Lord: my Spirit that is vpon thee, &amp; my woord which I haue put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seede, from hence foorth euen for euer. You saye likewise that the Churche can not erre in matters of faithe, because S. <hi>Paule</hi> saith shee is <hi>Columna &amp; Firmamentū veritatis:</hi> If she be the piller of truthe, let vs, I pray you, see the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:176688:7"/> of truthe, I meane the woord of God displayed in your Church, which (you say) is the piller thereof, and then we will not refuse to fight vnder your standard: But you haue hid the woorde of God from the multitude, in the close vessell of a straunge and vnknowne tonge, and from the rest in the darke dennes and dungeons of your owne expositions. For you will allowe thē to make no sence or construction thereof, otherwise than you shall ratifie and allow. And therfore if the Churche bee the piller of trueth, wee findinge no trueth with you, can acknowledge no true Church among you. I am to craue of you, euen by the mercies of Christ, that you would dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently peruse that whole chapter of S. <hi>Paule,</hi> where you gather that the Church can not erre, because shee is the piller and ground of trueth: and then you shall finde that it is not likelie by his dealing for her direction, and that by writing, euen in the least thinges, that he was of opinion shee could not erre. For he hath not left her vnto her owne iudgement vpon that hope, no not in matters, where there was the
<pb facs="tcp:176688:8"/> least feare of error &amp; deceit. The Apostle, as it appeareth in that chapter, had taught <hi>Timothie,</hi> that Bishops &amp; Deacons may be no dronkards, no fighters, no mē geuen to filthie lucre, no men whose children liue without awe or cōly order: that their wifes should be honest, no sclāderers, but sober &amp; faithfull in all things, Immediatly after these instructions hee hath these wordes, <hi>these things write I vnto the, trusting to come to the very shortlie, but if I tary long, that thou maiest know yet how to behaue thyselfe in the house of God, which is the church of the liuinge god, the piller &amp; ground of trueth. Saint Paul</hi> here derecteth <hi>Timothie</hi> by writing, how to beehaue himselfe for dealinges in the church, touching those things where error seemeth least to be feared. For who wold suspect the church of so much want in iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemēt, that shee were to be warned &amp; that by writinge, in hir choise of Ministers to beware of drunkards, fighters, couetous persons, &amp; men that cā not rule their owne housholds. A man would thinke that ciuill men, who haue no help but from fleshe and blood, were sufficiently able to discerne of
<pb facs="tcp:176688:8"/> thē selfs, that such infamous persons were not meet mē to serue in a place of so great credit. Who woulde not haue trusted the church w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> greater matters than these, if <hi>S.

For the church by whome they are to be chosen, hauinge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of such assistaunce continually frō the holy Ghost, as that it is not possible for her to erre, can order matters of greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie than these.

I hartely beseeche
<pb facs="tcp:176688:9"/> you to marke it well, that in the same place where you ground the Church can not erre, the Apostle hath left a doctrine vnto the Churche least shee shoulde erre, and that in matters most easy to be discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. So that if the Church bee void of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, it is not otherwise, than so farforthe as shee geueth an attentiue eare to the writinges of the Holy Ghost, which are geuen to keepe hir from swaruinge. For the Apostle doeth first instruct her by wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, before he tell vs of this priuiledge, which (you say) vpholdeth a fredom from erringe. How bee it you shall hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade any man of indifferent iudgement, that the Apostle would haue vs to cōceiue so highly of hir impossibility to erre in matters of faithe: as not to inquire whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shee followe therein the rule of the written woord: when in his owne practise, hee leaueth her not without direction in writinge, touching matters not of faithe, but (which is lesse subiect vnto errour) of conuersation: and that euen in the same place, where this priuiledge of hers see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be most vpholden by him. Saint
<pb facs="tcp:176688:9"/>
                  <hi>Paule</hi> instructeth a man with doctrine and principles of trueth, that he may knowe howe to behaue himselfe in the Churche, which is the piller of trueth: But you first of all without doctrine, thrust a man vpon your Churche: &amp; then force him to imbrace such doctrine, as ther he shal finde receiued without further examination: because (as you saie) it is the piller of trueth, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can not erre. I leaue it to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of euery indifferent reader to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whither this maner of proceding, bee any thing like vnto that course which the Apostle kepeth. It were the spediest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of al controuersies, although not the best, yf the one party should bee first put in possession, and ther vpon haue title vnto al thinges possessed: But it were the best, although not the spediest dispatche, if the title were first assuredly knowne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, &amp; thervpon the true owner put in possession. You will first haue the possessiō of the Church, &amp; thervpō be intitled to the trueth, and all other treasures thereof: Whereas you ought first to proue your title to the trueth to be good: &amp; then might
<pb facs="tcp:176688:10"/> you lawfully haue possession of the church. As concerninge the sense and meaning of that place of the Apostle, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> maketh an other exposition of it, than your Churche of Rome can digest. <hi>Est columna (inquit Chrysost.) ac firmamentum verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>

                  </hi> and <hi>Manichaeus</hi> two here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, came &amp; affirmed that they had the holy Ghost: therfore our Sauiour Christ least moe should bee seduced by that name, for as much as the gift was inuisible and not to bee sene, saith, when the holy Ghoste the spirit of trueth shall come, hee shall bringe my words vnto your remēbraunce, and shall lead you into all trueth. For he shall not speake of himselfe. For if you see any mā that saith, I haue the holy Ghost, and speaketh not out of the Gospel, but out of himselfe, he speaketh of himselfe, and the Holy Ghost is not in him. For as our Sauiour Christ said of himselfe, I speake not of my selfe, that therby he might take
<pb facs="tcp:176688:12"/> away all suspicion of deceit: Nay rather that hee might put a plaine difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene trueth and error: in like maner that he might declare who they bee, that haue the holy Ghoste, and who haue him not, he saith: ye haue heard of me, what I haue deliuered, to wit: that when the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Spirit shall come, he shall speake of me. If ye shall see any man confirming his cause by the Gospell, that man hath the Holy Ghost, for the Holy Ghost shall come that hee maie bringe to your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, such things as I haue taught.

Your church therfore which stādeth especiallie vpon this point: Wee are the church &amp; therfore can not erre: hath not the holy Ghost: for the holy Ghost appealeth not to himselfe.

                  <pb facs="tcp:176688:12"/> of God, and as he saith a plaine distinctiō betweene error &amp; trueth: then nede we not inquire from what place or people hee cometh, as if he were only bound to them that had antiquity &amp; consent to alledge for their Religion: but are to content vs with this (as the true note) to wit that the spirit of God doeth not speake of himselfe, but out of the woord and Gospel of God. Our charge is not geuen vs from god, to make iniquisition from what people he cometh, but with what voice he speaketh. For if he speake of himselfe, that is, if he iustifie not that which he saith by the Gospel of god, he is a deceiuer, what antiquity &amp; consent soeuer bee alledged for him. And therfore <hi>Chrysost.</hi> in the same place, immediatly after the words nowe alledged, speakinge against the heretique <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> saith thus: <hi>Vbi legisti haec? ex quo non legit haec scripta, sed a seipso loquitur, manifestum est quod non habet spiritum sanctum.</hi> Where hast thou read these things? seinge that he readeth not these thinges in the scripture, but speaketh of himself, it is manifest that he hath not the holy Ghost. Would to god
<pb facs="tcp:176688:13"/> that you &amp; suche as you are, who binde the trueth, &amp; therfore the holy Ghost the spirit of truethe, vnto antiquity, succession of Bishopps, &amp; consent of people: grounding your Religion thervpon: would carefully consider of the iudgement, not onely of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> but of Christ himself: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to discerne who they bee, that haue the spirit of god, and who haue him not: then should you clearly se that he is to be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his spech, &amp; neither by his yeares, nor yet by the great traine &amp; multitude of mē w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> follow after him, &amp; least of al by the order that they obserue in followinge one an other. His speach doeth so plainely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray him, that <hi>Chrysostome</hi> is not afraid to saye, it is a manifest matter, not subiect to any exception, that if any read not out of the written woord that which they teach other, those same haue not the holy Ghost. For the holy Ghost which was promised, was promised to bee such a one, as should not speake of himselfe, but appeale vnto the Gospel and woord of God for his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Any man therefore may clearlie se, howe iustlie we chalenge that Spirit that
<pb facs="tcp:176688:13"/> speaketh in your Church not to be the holy Ghost, for hee appealeth to himselfe, his Councels and Doctors, makinge vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue that there is no certainty in the word, and therfore no safe testimony to bee had from thence: not driuing vs to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there to enquire after him: but pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge vs from thence vnto the Churche, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she can not (as he saith) be deceiued. The speaches of your Spirit are these: Thus beleueth the Church, which can not erre, this is confirmed by councels and warranted by Doctors: This hath for it antiquity, vniuersality and consent. The voice of the holy Ghoste is this: haue you not read in your lawe? it is written of me in the volume of the booke: the scripture must be fulfilled: it is thus written.

<pb facs="tcp:176688:14"/> I would be resolued of this one thinge by you, why our Sauiour Christ shoulde put himselfe vpon the Scriptures for his triall being head of the Churche: and you taking your selues for mēbers therof, yet refuse it.

I doe therfore much marueile howe you can satisfie your owne conscience, in groundinge your faithe and perswading your self touching religion, to rest safely whersoeuer you shal find a nōber of people professing religion, who of long time together with a great nomber haue obserued the same: seing that our Sauiour Christ neuer vsed any such reason to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> were enimies vnto trueth.

Is it not written in your lawe? And when the deuill came vnto him,

Wee may see also in this practise of our sauiour Christ, a plaine confutatiō of your strongest reason, which moueth you to fly frō the scriptures vnto fathers, Doctors, and the churche. You were wont to saye if one alledge scriptures for his purpose, and another holdinge a contrarie opinion, shall likewise bringe in scriptures to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlde his iudgement: how shal the trueth bee tried but by the writinges and exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of fathers vpon these places? Heere you see that Sathan would perswade his purpose by scripturs, our Sauiour Christ flieth not for defence vnto the Churche, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the writings of the learned Iewes, and the expositions of the Rabbines vpon that place, but by an other place of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, beateth out the true sence &amp; meaning
<pb facs="tcp:176688:16"/> of that which was misaleaged by Sathan: to wit, that he might so hope for helpe and defence from God, as that he stode bound neuerthelesse to vse such meanes as the Lord should giue into his handes, because it was written in an other place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God;</hi> which he should haue done, if hauing meanes to goe downe safely, hee should for all that haue cast himselfe headlonge off the pinnacle, in hope that the Lorde woulde not suffer him to dashe his foote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a stone. You maye see that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath in it self sufficient light, to cleare and make plaine the darke places of her self: And therfore they ar iustlie charged to be infected with a most dangerous heresy, who perswade &amp; mainteyne a great doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and obscuritie to bee in the word, therby to shunne the reproufe of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion &amp; conuersatiō: according as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> testifieth in his third booke.<note place="margin">Irenaeus lib. 3.

<pb facs="tcp:176688:19"/> remember that this people whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to bring againe out of captiuitie, &amp; then to giue them one hart and one waie: had alreadie a kinde of vnity and consent among them:<note place="margin">Iere. 32. vers. 32</note> for the Prophet in this same chapter affirmeth, that the Princes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Priests and people had consented to turne their backes vpon the Lord, and had set their Idolls in the house whervpō his name was called. And this their vnity and agreement in such corrupt doctrine &amp; worshippe of God, was the cause why the Lord (as he had decreed to punish them by geuinge them ouer into the handes of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>) euen so did execute the same decree in deede, And yet not so, but that he promiseth afterward in his time to bring them home againe to their owne land: and then to giue them one hart and one way to feare him, and to plant sincere Religion &amp; the true feare of god among them. You may see by this place, that there is no true vnity but in veritie and truthe, because the Lord speaketh vnto this people, who had great agreement in their corruption tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the seruice of God: as if they had bene at deadly dissention: sayinge, I will
<pb facs="tcp:176688:19"/> giue them one hart and one waye. Your doctrin is not the veritie, as God willinge shalbe plainly proued when I come to that place, and therfore your agreement howe great soeuer, is the most dangerous diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that can be, for that it is sundred from the trueth of Christ and his Gospel. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore against you with this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that because you haue not the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with you, therefore you haue no vnitie among you. For this place plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that it is true doctrine and religion, which maketh men to be of one harte and one waye, in so much that the Lord when he promiseth to restore sincere worshippe and seruice of God, saith, I wil giue them one hart and one way. Our harts &amp; wayes doe newer growe vnto any vnity in deede, before they bee established in true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: but be so variable, that wee may bee ledde by the crafty wilinesse of men, from one error into another without any stoppe or staie.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may see howe your first witnesse reprooueth your iudgmēt touching Vnitie, without any mention of veritie and trueth. I truste you will giue mee good leaue to deale by waye of demaunde with you, so longe as I haue no other meaninge, then in this our disputation of vnitie, to set you and your witnesse at one.

And if you say they were the Church, then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare me howe these two hang together, that the Lorde promiseth in the tyme to come, and after their returne to giue them one hart and one waie, which is (as you say) ment of vnitie, wheras you are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that there is no true Church, if there bee not already vnitie among them.

               <p>Besides this you are to be put in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that albeit our Sauiour Christ praied for vnitie, that it might, be graunted vnto his disciples to be one, yet
<pb facs="tcp:176688:22"/> that prooueth not that without imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they did enioy it, for he prayeth in like manner in the same Chapter for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that they might be deliuered from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, Nowe who knoweth not, that his be greatly subiect to euil, whether you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande it of outwarde or inwarde euilles, spirituall or temporall, as wee call them, and yet notwithstanding that prayer was heard for them as well as this. I say ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that as the Church is voide of euill, so is it of dissention and variance, and as it is troubled notwithstanding this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with euil and oftentimes geueth great offence by falling into the same: So is it in like manner with discorde and dissention. These speaches therefore which bee absolute in them selues are by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Learned, to be limited ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that measure which is graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto man to attaine vnto, and not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely to bee pressed as you doe.</p>
               <p>You alledge moreouer for proofe of your assertion, out of the Actes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles that there was in the primitiue<note place="margin">Actes. 4.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:176688:22"/> Church <hi>vnum Cor &amp; vna anima,</hi> One heart and one minde. It is true that there was greate agreement in that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which was as it were the first fruites of the spirit of God, and of the Apostles doctrine and laboures: and such an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement as Churches planted after by the Apostles themselues had not the like, as it is apparant in the Churche of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and yet a true Churche, and so called and accounted of by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paule.</hi> There was such vnitie of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection among them, that they liberally employed their goodes one vppon an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as necessitie required, and albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the vnitie of minde and affection which they had among them selues was verie great, yet it was not so vniuersal, as that it did admit no exception of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, for we reade immediately after of two <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira:</hi> that were not so single hearted toward their bretheren as the rest, and therefore recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved punishment accordingly. But I pray you marke that it is sayd there <hi>Multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis credentiū, erat cor vnum &amp; anima vna:</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:176688:23"/> They were faithfull and beleeuers of the woorde of God, and not seruantes and slaues to the traditions of men, that had this Veritie among them. Vnitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is in this place (as before) restrained vnto veritie and trueth. So that if you looke for any helpe from hence you are to prooue the trueth of your doctrine, before you bring in the vnitie of your affections. But let this be graunted, what haue you saide for your selfe? yee haue brought for proofe one exāple, if you had brought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these, a Logiciā would haue answea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you, that examples prooue nothing, &amp; what exceptiōs may be taken against your one example? was there not murmuring &amp; complayning immediately after, among this number, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> are said there to be of one heart &amp; mind, for that the Grecians their widowes were not prouided for,<note place="margin">Actes. 6.</note> and therevpon a newe order taken for their better prouision? and were not two of this number, whose heartes were saide to be one, hunted out from among the rest, and made a Spectacle of the iustice of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst<note place="margin">Actes. 5.</note>

Now the daunger of diuision is greater as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience doeth tell vs in the continuance and encrease of the Church, then at the first planting and building of the same, so that an example of vnitie in the Church long continued and encreased, had beene more forcible and fit to induce vs, then this of the Church newly planted.</p>

If hee speake of Vnitie in doctrine and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes in this place as you say, his praier for it, doeth rather argue a want to be as yet in thē of the thing, then to importe any present possession thereof. For wee are not woont to pray for the thinges we haue
<pb facs="tcp:176688:24"/> alreadie, and you know your Assertion mainteineth that vnitie can neuer be sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from the Church because it is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall note and badge thereof. The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie out of the Epistle to the <hi>Corinthes</hi> is directly against your Assertion,<note place="margin">1.

I finde there no mention of manie of these which you doe set forth as the principall woorkes, but great commendation of others which you haue not so much as once named. I doe finde there great commendation of one <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithfull, a great rich man, not for building of Churches, Hospitalles, or Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but for leauing his friendes, and countrie, going out from among them, at the commaundement of the Lorde,

               <p>Blame mee not if I doe require your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull consideration hereof, for the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of these Spirits maye not lightly be let passe. The one sauereth of the earth so doeth not the other. For if a wordly man that was neuer brought vp in the schole of Christ, bee asked his iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the good deede of that man whoe doeth builde a Colledge, and of another whoe leaueth his countrie with <hi>Abraham</hi> at the commandement of God: he wil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that of buildinge a Colledge farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the other, as beinge a visible monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that contineweth for euer, commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to many: full of glory in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment almost of euery man: whereas the memory of thother passeth awaye with the deede done, commodious (as cōmodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is measured in worldly respects) vnto none, subiect vnto the mislikinge of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit nomber. And as concerninge all those
<pb facs="tcp:176688:34"/> deedes that you do reckon vp in forme and manner as you doe them, wicked men haue practised thē all, &amp; men that neuer heard of the Gospel wold if cōparison were made, preferre them before these which are regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by the holy Ghost, as the best deedes of the best men. Yours would weigh more with wordly minded men. And therefore we may safely say that they are of th' earth &amp; not from aboue, for the world loueth and liketh her owne. My meaninge is not to speake against or to mislike in any respect, buildinge of Colledges Hospitals &amp; chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, when they proceede of a hart purified by faith, &amp; therfore seking the glory of god &amp; not his own therin, &amp; be ordeyned for the aduauncinge of God his word &amp; true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, not to the maintenaunce of Idolatry and superstition. Thus much generally for workes, to let you see what is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sappe that maketh the tree good, &amp; what be the frutes that are left in the register of the holye Ghost, as the best workes of the best men. Now let vs come particularly vnto the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral good deedes w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> you set downe. First for prayer. Wee vse and practise it as the
<pb facs="tcp:176688:35"/> speciall weapon of a Christian souldiour, we offer it vnto God as a speciall part of his glory, which he will not communicate with any other: wee teache men to pray in spirit and trueth: not in an vnknowne tongue without any vnderstanding of the trueth, and therfore without any affectiō of spirit vnto that trueth. The scripture that commendeth fastinge and alloweth it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth nor approueth your manner of fasting. Compare your fasting with that which we doe read of <hi>Ioel. cap. 2. Ionas cap. 3. Nehemias. <hi>9.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Aug de ciui. dei. lib. 18. cap. 36.</note>] In that Chapter there is no such matter. I thinke you meane the thirtie sixe Chapter of that booke, there are the same woordes that you doe alledge, but I haue to charge you of not setting downe the whole sentence, but supressing of that which openeth the whole matter, you shal giue me leaue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to set downe the whole sentēce as it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. His words are these: <hi>Ab hoc tēpore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Iudaeos restituto templo, non reges sed principes fuerunt vsque ad Aristobulum,
<pb facs="tcp:176688:40"/> quorum supputatio temporum, non in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turis sanctis quae canonicae appellantur, sed in aliis inuenitur, in quibus sunt &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabaeorum libri: quos non Iudaei, sed ecclesia pro canonicis habet, propter quorundam Martyrum passiones vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes atque mirabiles. <hi>Augustine</hi>
                  </hi> as you see, affirmeth this supputation of time not to be found in the holy Scriptures which are called canonicall, but in other bookes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the which are the bookes of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees: He declareth plainely that the bookes of the Machabees are others and diuerse from the bookes of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are called canonicall: <hi>Non in Scripturis sanctis, quae appellantur canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae, sed in aliis, in quibus sunt &amp; Machabae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum libri:</hi> he doeth not say, <hi>in quibus erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re opinionis Iudaei existimant esse Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeorum libros:</hi> But these are his wordes, <hi>In quibus sunt &amp; Machabaeorum libri.</hi> Hee doeth not say that they are falsly thought by the Iewes to be among other bookes, which are not called canonical, but expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they are among bookes that be not called canonicall. You lay fast holde vpon
<pb facs="tcp:176688:40"/> this other half of the sentēce: <hi>Quos non Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daei, sed ecclesia pro canonicis habet:</hi> If you will haue none of that that goeth before, I pray you let vs haue that, that foloweth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly: <hi>Propter quorundam martyrū pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siones.</hi> The church reckoneth of the bookes of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> as if they were canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, because of the suffering of certain mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres. If they were altogither and simply canonicall, what meaneth he to adde any particular respect, as this is, <hi>[Propter pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siones martyrum,]</hi> for the suffering of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, why they should be accounted cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical. If his meaning be in his latter part, to heale whatsoeuer was wounded by him in the former, why is not his plaister as large as the wound? In the former part of the sentence without any condition or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, he had affirmed that the bookes of the Machabees were not amōg the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are called canonical, now whē he should as you thinke heale this long and large woūd, he cōmeth with a litle plaister and telleth vs of one cause in respect wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of these books were reputed of the church
<pb facs="tcp:176688:41"/> as if they were canonicall. And that it is his manner not to speake of those bookes with generall allowance and approbation as he doeth of canonicall scriptures, but with condition, cautions, and particular allowance for some one speciall cause, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> hee neuer doeth of the canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: It appereth in his second booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the second Epistle of <hi>Gaudentius <hi>cap. 23.</hi>
                  </hi> Where disputing against the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natistes,</hi> who alledged the fact of <hi>Razis,</hi> for the murthering of them selues, he hath these woords: <hi>Et hanc quidem scripturam, quae appellatur Machabeorū non habēt Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daei sicut legem, Prophetas, &amp; Psalmos, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus dominus testimonium perhibuit tanquā testibus suis dicens: oportet omnia impleri, quae scripta sunt in lege, &amp; prophetis, &amp; psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis de me: sed recepta est ab ecclesia non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utiliter, si sobriè legatur vel audiatur, maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè propter illos Machabeos qui pro dei lege sicut veri martyres a persequutoribus tam indigna atque horrenda perpessi sunt.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider wel with what cautions this book is compassed about by <hi>Augustine,</hi> and how spare his allowance is vnto it, in respect of the Canonicall Scripture.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:176688:41"/>
               <p>It is receiued of the church, saith <hi>August.</hi> not vnprofitably, if it bee reade soberly, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for those <hi>Machabees,</hi> that suffered so many thinges of the persecutours for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lawe of God, that the Christians (saith he) may learne from hence that the afflictions of this time are not worthy of that glory which shalbe reuealed. Out of this Epistle of <hi>Augustine,</hi> we may learne an aunswere for that place alledged by you of <hi>Iudas Machabeus</hi> his fart. The <hi>Donatistes</hi> (as appeareth in that epistle) alledged <hi>Razis</hi> his killing of himself, (w<seg rend="sup">c</seg> is commended in the <hi>14.</hi> chapter of the <hi>2.</hi> booke of <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi>) as an example to approue the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theringe of themselues: euen as you do the fact of <hi>Iudas Machabeus</hi> for prayer for the dead. His answeare is this. <hi>Non debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus quicquid in scripturis etiam Dei testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monio laudatos homines fecisse legerimus consentiendo approbare: sed considerando discernere, adhibentes iudicium non nostrae auctoritatis sed Scripturarum sanctarum atque diuinarum.</hi> You may see that hee would not haue vs builde vpon priuate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples &amp; factes, albeit the men that haue
<pb facs="tcp:176688:42"/> done them were good &amp; cōmended by God himselfe, but to discerne of them by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the scriptures. This example therefore of <hi>Iudas Machabaeus</hi> touching the dead, may not by the authoritie of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> forthwith be yelded vnto because it was his doinge, except being discerned by the Scripture, it bee founde to receiue confirmation from thence. For priuate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples can make no general rules of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. <hi>Augustine</hi> his iudgement for the authoritie of these bookes you greatly stād vpon: &amp; therefore his iudgement of priuate examples and factes I hope you will not mislyke. Neither haue wee onely his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to lead vs not simply to approue this or any like fact, before it bee examined by the holy Scriptures: but his practise also in this same chapter disalowing the fact of <hi>Razis,</hi> which is commended by the Author of those bookes, and crossing the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral thinges geuen out there as matter to his great commendation.</p>
               <p>Wee are therfore no bolder with this Author in this our attempt, then <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:176688:42"/> himself is with him, in another priuate fact commended not a litle by the same man.</p>
               <p>Peraduenture you desire to knowe what that diuersitie is which hee maketh betweene the Churche of God nowe, and the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as concerninge these bookes.</p>
               <p>This it is, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> neuer closed those bookes with the Canonicall vnder one prayer of clapses as the Churche doeth now readinge them togither with thother, And yet they cary with them euen nowe their note of difference and imperfection, that wee may not take their authoritie suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to confirme any Doctrine, and that by the iudgement &amp; practise of the church, accordinge as <hi>Ierom</hi> testifieth in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face vpon the Prouerbes of <hi>Solomon:</hi> his woordes are these: <hi>Sicut Iudith &amp; Tobiae &amp; Machabaeorum libros legit quidē eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, sed eos inter canonicas scripturas non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit: Sic &amp; haec duo volumina legat ad aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationem plebis, nō ad authoritatē Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticorū dogmatū confirmādā.</hi> As y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church
<pb facs="tcp:176688:43"/> readeth the bookes of <hi>Iudith, Tobias,</hi> and the <hi>Machabees,</hi> but receiueth them not for Canonicall scriptures: so it may read these two bookes (meaning the booke of <hi>Wisdō</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi>) for the edifyinge of the people, but not for to get authoritie and confirmation to any Ecclesiasticall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niō. You heare <hi>Ierome</hi> say that the church doeth not receiue the bookes of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees</hi> as canonicall scripture, that they are not of authoritie to cōfirme any thing in cōtrouersy, here is not <hi>(Iudaei nō recipiūt) sed Ecclesia non recipit.</hi> If these words. <hi>Diligit Dominus portas Syon super omnia taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula Iacob,</hi> import this meaninge (as you think they doe) that the Lord hath opened more of his trueth touching the authoritie of those bookes, &amp; so of prayer for the dead, vnto his churche since Christ, then hee did before vnto the Iewes, because hee loued <hi>Syon</hi> more thā <hi>Iacob:</hi> why doe you fetch your authoritie of praying for the dead out of the tabernacles of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and not out of the gates of <hi>Syon,</hi> out of the oulde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not out of the newe? You can not finde prayer for the dead in all <hi>Syon</hi> wher
<pb facs="tcp:176688:43"/> the loue of the Lorde is so aboundantly to be seene, you are glad to seeke into the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and finding no succour there neither, at last you light vpon a pore tente, which bewrayeth it selfe not to be of the same buildinge with <hi>Iacobs</hi> taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. For the Author of those bookes cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth pardon if hee haue swarued in anye thing, which the holy Ghost is neuer found to haue done. It is farre from that spirit of all trueth, to feare fallinge into errour in any of his doings, so it is also from him that is god almightie in power equall with the father, to say, <hi>If I haue spokē slenderly &amp; barely, it is that I coulde:</hi> as if any thinge were impossible vnto God. I neede not to labour greatly for the discredite of your authorities, for they are at such variance w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> me in thēselues, that one doeth ouerthrowe another. For your first authoritie saith, that prayer for the dead is deliuered in writing from the holy Ghost: Your other authorities that followe they saye it is not so, but that it is only deliuered vs by word of mouthe and practise from the Apostles: for so doe you afterward define of traditiō,
<pb facs="tcp:176688:44"/> opposing it vnto the written word as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther member. And therefore I pray you consider howe these doe depende one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that in your first authoritie you should say: <hi>[Dicit scriptura,]</hi> alleaging the <hi>Machabees,</hi> and afterwarde saye: <hi>[Dicit traditio.]</hi> For <hi>Chrysostome</hi> &amp; <hi>Augustine</hi> whome you bringe in afterward, say that it is a tradition of the Apostles: &amp; therfore either your Scripture is no Scripture, or else their tradition is no tradition. You must remember what <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith in the first chapter of his thirde booke. <hi>Non per alios dispositionem salutis nostrae cognoui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, quàm per eos per quos Euangelium peruenit ad nos, quod quidem tunc praeconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auerunt, postea verò per Dei voluntatem in Scripturis nobis tradiderunt, fundamentum &amp; columnam Fidei nostrae futurum.</hi> Wee knowe not our saluation by any other then these, by whome the Gospel hath come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, which then they preached, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde by the wil of God left it in writing to bee the piller and foundation of our faith. That which the Apostles by the wil
<pb facs="tcp:176688:44"/> of God left vs in writinge, must bee the grounde of our faith. And therefore I am to require you to begin there, and then to declare and prooue, howe faithfully you haue succeded them in that doctrine which they taught. Wee finde not this Doctrine in that Scripture which the Apostles left written vnto vs, to bee (as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> faith) the piller and grounde worke of our faith: and therfore wee can not finde you to haue succeeded them in this Doctrine: vnlesse you can proue that they had this doctrine. For to succeed a man in any thing, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily inferreth, that the same man must haue had that thinge before. If you wold haue proued your Doctrine of good woorkes to haue beene Apostolical, you shoulde haue prooued that the Apostles taught the same woorkes in the same manner that you doe. I dare therefore boldly say, and shalbee ready at all tymes to prooue, that you are not the Apostles successors in your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of sanctification. And as you haue not beene faithfull vnto the Apostles, to succeede them truely in their Doctrine,
<pb facs="tcp:176688:45"/> no more haue you beene vnto others that came after them, who albeit they swarued some thing frō the purity of the Apostles, yet were they farre of from such great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptiō as you of late tyme haue embraced. For proofe hereof let vs consider what that memorial of the dead was, which <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Areopagita</hi> reporteth to bee the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Apostles. I will not nowe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute whether he were <hi>Paule</hi> his scholer or no, neither yet whether those Canons w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> you speake of, were the Apostles Canons. Only this I wil say, that it were as hard a piece of worke as euer you tooke in hande, by good and sufficient authoritie to iustifie these your assertions. It is written, not as you quoat it in his booke, <hi>[De coelesti hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchia,]</hi> but in the <hi>7. <hi>cap.</hi>
                  </hi> of his booke. <hi>De Ecclesiastica hierarchia,</hi> where you shall plainly vnderstande that your church hath not suceeded him in his doctrine, touching the memorial of the dead, albeit you alledg his authoritie for your defence.

True it is, there is mention there of praier for the deade, (for I will deale otherwise with you then you doe with me) not hiding anie thing of that, that seemeth to make most against me. <hi>Precatur oratio illa (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit Dionysius) diuinam clementiam, vt cū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta dimittat per infirmitatem humanam admissa peccata defuncto, eúm{que} in luce sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuat &amp; regione viuorum, in sinibus Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hae, Isaac, &amp; Iacob: ista vt reor perspicua sunt beatissima sanctorum praemia.</hi> In this praier for the deade it is required of God for him, that his sinnes may be forgeuen,

               <p>Let vs see what helpe you haue from <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> he saith that the memorial of the dead is a tradition of the Apostles, and that it bringeth much profit vnto them.

Whatsoeuer it was that hee prayed to haue graunted from the Lorde vnto his mother, hee himselfe confesseth that hee did beleue his mother had obteined it before his prayer. These are his wordes in that same place. <hi>Credo iam feceris quod te rogo, sed voluntaria mea approba Domine.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue that thou hast already performed that which I desire of thee, but allowe my good

This prayer acknowlegeth no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of duety layed vpon him by the lawe of God, but that it was onely the franck &amp; voluntary gift of a man that wished well vnto her. And in very deed it is true that he saith it was volūtary, for he had no paterne or example in the canonicall Scriptures, neither in the olde nor yet in the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to leade him therunto.

<pb facs="tcp:176688:51"/> and sumptuous, and that they had the least care of that, when they bestowed most care and cost vpon the other.<note place="margin">Hieron. ad Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot. de vita cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricorum.</note>
                  <hi>Hierome</hi> cōplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of this in his tyme saying. <hi>Multi aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant parietes, &amp; columnas Ecclesiae sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struunt, marmor a nitent, auro splendent la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quearia, gemmis altare distinguitur, at mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrorum Christi nulla electio est.</hi> Many build the walles &amp; pillers of the church, the marble shineth, the beames glister with gould, the altare is pointed &amp; deuided with precious stones, but there is no choise of the Ministers. If euer this complaint of <hi>Ierome</hi> was verified, it was in the tyme of Popery. For there was no want of beawty in the material temple, but the true temple was suffered to fall in to vtter decaye, and how coulde it bee otherwyse for there was no choise of the Ministers, who where to build the true churche of God, euery man was thought sufficiently able, whoe coulde read the Masse booke, albeit he vnderstode neuer a worde thereof.</p>
               <p>My chiefe purpose is to geue you to vnderstande, that when the materiall
<pb facs="tcp:176688:52"/> churche hath bene in greatest beawty, the godly and learned haue complayned, that men whoe are the true and liuing churche, haue bene the furthest from the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; feare of God. Which could not be otherwise, when those who were to finishe that worke, were altogither ignorant, and no choise made of thē, but (as we say) tagge and ragge admitted therunto without any exception taken either against learning or life. And therefore you may cleerly see by <hi>Hierome</hi> his complaint, that building of Churches and Altars, are not the surest notes of the faith of Christ, because those haue bene builded, whē there haue bin such ignorant &amp; lewde Ministers, that it coulde not be otherwyse, but that true faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion must goe to ruine and decay. Wee may plainly see and perceiue, that mē haue pleased themselues so in those kinde of workes: that the godly haue perceiued a decaye of the greatest dueties, either to bee supported by the glistring shewe therof, or else not to be espied &amp; rightly examined. And the trueth is so, that they are in very deede so glistring to the sight of a naturall

And in verie deede, wee neuer haue sene or read that they haue bene in great credit, but that thervpō hath growne a smal accompt of true Christian workes and of the best deedes.

<pb facs="tcp:176688:57"/> one word for succession either of Bishops or Doctrine, no not one word that can bee wrong that way, and I hope you doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that to haue bene your purpose to prooue. These woordes that you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, signifie thus much in our tongue: The holy Ghoste hath appointed you Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, to gouerne the church of god, which he hath purchased with his bloode. What I pray you is here to bee gathered for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall succession? In this place the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle telleth the Bishoppes of <hi>Ephesus</hi> that their charg is great, to be betrusted with those whom the Lord hath purchased with no lesse price than his bloode: But as for succession of Doctrine and Bishops, that it shalbe continuall, there is not one worde that soundeth that way. And therefore I pray you euen as you tender your owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiō, that you would not suffer your selues to be carried away with so weake groūds. But I pray you seeinge this witnesse co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from heauen, let vs heare more of him. And good reason it is that he shoulde be hearde at large, for he is the onely wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that you bringe from aboue, to testifie
<pb facs="tcp:176688:58"/> with you for your doctrine that it is Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall. I pray you read the two verses followinge this, which you haue alledged. You shall finde it there written thus. <hi>Ego enim, noui hoc, quod ingressuri sunt post dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessum meum lupi graues in vos, non par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes gregi: &amp; ex vobis ipsis exorientur viri loquentes peruersa, vt abducant disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulos post se.</hi> Doe you not see that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warneth the Bishops of <hi>Ephesus</hi> to looke wel to themselues, and to their charges, because he knew that after his departure woolues would enter vpon the flocke, and that out of themselues woulde arise men speaking peruerse thinges to drawe disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after them. Heere is a prophecy that Woolues shal shortly enter into the flock: Nay which more is, there is heere a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling that some of themselues shall dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat into woolues. This authoritie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that foretelleth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> entring in of woolfs, &amp; prophesieth of the degenerating of some of themselues into woolues, is a weake ground to builde succession vpon, &amp; to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade vs that wee ought to imbrace that doctrine, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> can bring for it only succession of good persons or places. If you shal well

                  <hi>Augustine</hi> vpon the <hi>Psalme 44.</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the church may not take her self to be forsaken because she seeth not <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paule,</hi> but he prooueth not, neither spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth so much as one word for a continuall succession of Bishops, to continewe vnto the end of the world as a marke of the true church, whoe are to deliuer their places or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and their doctrine truly without any corruption vnto others. Peraduenture you thinke that because <hi>Augustin</hi> interpreteth this place of scripture so, that he will haue the childrē to signifie bishops, &amp; then saith in the plural nomber that they shal remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy name for euer: that therefore there must be a continual succession of Bishops. This error groweth vpon the ignoraūce of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue: for ther the berbe is in the singular nōber, &amp; so it is in the trāslatiō of the <hi>Septuaginta.</hi> It is likewise so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by <hi>Hierom,</hi> who had more skill in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue then <hi>Augustine</hi> had, and referred not vnto Bishoppes but vnto
<pb facs="tcp:176688:59"/> the Churche, that shee shall remember the name of the Lord for euer.<note place="margin">Hieron. ad princip. virgin.</note> His wordes are these: <hi>Regina quae steterat a dexteris tuis in vestitu deaurato, &amp; iussa fuerat obliuisci populi &amp; domus patris sui, iterum illi dictum erat, pro patribus tuis nati sunt tibi filij, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitues eos principes super omnem terram: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligens quanta sit decoranda gloria, &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus praemijs subleuanda, conuertit ad spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum voces suas: &amp; pollicetur recordaturam se semper nominis sponsi, in omni generatione &amp; generatione.</hi> You may heare howe <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> saith it is the Churche that shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the name of the lord for euer, and not as you woulde haue it the Bishoppes onely.</p>
               <p>That the Churche receiueth foure Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles and no moe, that it geueth the name of Person &amp; trinity vnto God, not because the scripture expresly directeth vs in these thinges, but because it doeth not speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst then (as you say) and because it is so deliuered vnto vs from the Apostles: doeth nothing at all prooue, that the groundes of faith &amp; religion which the apostles taught, shall remaine vnto the ende of the worlde
<pb facs="tcp:176688:59"/> in the safe custody of Bishops: &amp; that they shall truely deliuer thē ouer to their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, so as we may safely sticke to succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as a true note of the Churche. I doe meruaile that you doe so greatly forget your selfe and the matter that you haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand to proue. Is this the doctrine of the Apostles touching saluation, or their tradition? your purpose is to prooue that the doctrine of the Apostles left in writing cōcerning the grounds of faith &amp; Religiō, is deliuered frō Bishop to Bishop in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> true sense &amp; vnderstāding therof, by a perpetual succession for the benefite of the Churche. Therfore as before you coulde finde no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of person, so here you faile in finding succession of doctrine. If al that is brought be true, yet is nothing proued but a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of some tradition. For there is not one word spoken for the reseruing of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vnto the church in the true sense and vnderstāding therof. Nowe for the things themselues, the Churche of God by the word tryeth true teachers from false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, &amp; true Doctrine from counterfaite and corrupt. And so are we exhorted to doe,
<pb facs="tcp:176688:60"/> And albeit the scripture hath not expresly set downe the very woords of Trinity and person, yet hath it set downe al that trueth which is conteined in these woords, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the church was directed to make choise of such woordes, for the better explaning of matters in controuersy. It appeareth by <hi>Augustine</hi> that the Churche had not onely the scriptures not speaking against the name of Trinity, but leading them to to vse that name. His woordes are these. <hi>Nobis autem sufficiat scire de Trinitate,</hi>

               <p>Hee placeth true knowledge in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles doctrine, and in the olde state of the Churche, as knowledge was geuen therof by those Bishops, to whome the Apostles committed the Churches, that were then in the tyme of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in any place. All the succession that heere is mencioned, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyned vnto those Bishoppes who weare immediatly after the Apostles, at whose hands they receiued those Churches. Now that this knowledge came truely to him &amp; his time from those Bishops: this induceth him to thinke so, because they receiued frō them, <hi>Scripturarum tractationem plenissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam:</hi> A plentiful treatise of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, without suspiciō of forgery or falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.

<pb facs="tcp:176688:61"/> that they onely haue the true sence therof because they are the Church that cannot erre: Thirdly because there was in that auncient state of the Churche to be seene, <hi>Praecipuum dilectionis munus:</hi> The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test fruite of loue euen to offer themselues vnto martyrdome in great numbers and multitudes, by reason of that loue which they did beare vnto God and his Gospel: <hi>Multitudinem enim martyrū praemittit ad Deum patrem.</hi> If this testimonie of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> had holpen you, it shoulde not haue mencioned those Bishops onely to whom the Apostles deliuered the Churches, but spoken of an orderly succession of them to continue foreuer without anie rstrainte, Neither should he haue spoken so spating<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the matter, as to haue saide it came safe to their handes, who were so neere the Apostles time by them who succeeded the Apostles: but without anie suspicion of alteration, he should haue geuen it foorth as a matter appointed and established, whereby to keepe doctrine safe vnto the Church for euer. And last of all he should haue suppressed the notes of their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb facs="tcp:176688:62"/> consisting in the reseruing of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without forgery or falsefiyng: and in warranting their expositiōs by scriptures: &amp; in hauing to be seene the principal effect of loue: w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is multitudes of martyrs dying for the Gospel, and haue sent vs only vnto succession, charging vs to receiue that w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we shal finde obserued there, without any further question, because succession was appointed to bee an infallible note of the Churche in al tymes, which is the piller of trueth. You see he dealeth farre otherwise. If wee had receiued from your Bishops a diligent examination of your writings by the scriptures, (&amp; that ye had not left them &amp; gone to fathers, councels, &amp; traditions, charging vs to sticke vnto succession) with that other note which he calleth the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal effect of loue: than might we haue said with <hi>Irenaeus, <hi>Agnitio vera peruenit vs{que} ad nos.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:176688:62"/> knowledge in it, and to bee agreable to the ancient estate of the churche, because those three notes that hee speaketh of are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly to be seene in our churches.

<pb facs="tcp:176688:66"/> could forge such a succession (saith hee) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like then it is not altogither vnpossible so to doe, yet would it helpe them nothing, because the Apostles doctrine compared with theirs, would bewray it not to bee the Apostles nor Apostolical. You haue cause therefore to bee ashamed euer hereafter, to make successiō of bishops a necessary note of the church, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> by <hi>Tertull.</hi> his iudgement is subiect to forgery, &amp; if it were not, yet could not proue any ting at al (as he saith) when the doctrine of the Apostles shallbe found diuerse and disagreeing from theirs. You may see that he wil haue the Apostles doctrine, to confute &amp; ouerthrowe that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession which vpholdeth any doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary or diuerse from theirs. And consider this one thing wel I pray you, that he saith Heretikes are to be brought to the triall of the Apostles doctrine, by those Churches which albeit they bring none of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles nor Apostolicall men for theire Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and first founders (as being a long tyme after them) yet are neuer a whit the lesse to be accōpted Apostolicall, by reason
<pb facs="tcp:176688:66"/> of their kindred &amp; alliaūce w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the Apostles doctrine. He affirmeth plainely and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse woordes, that the churches which were long after the Apostles tyme, are to be tried whether they be apostolical or no, by that Doctrine which the Apostles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered: But as for these Churches that were next vnto the Apostles time, they dare be boulde (saith hee) to prouoke Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes ioyntly to the triall of succession as wel of person, as of doctrine. Succession therfore of Bishops is (by <hi>Tertullian</hi> his iudgement) no triall of Churches at this time, his authoritie hath vtterly euerthrowē that holde of yours. Marke wel the words for they are <hi>Tertullian</hi> his woordes and not myne. <hi>Ad hanc ita{que} formam prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buntur ab illis Ecclesiis, quae licet nullum ex apostolis vel Apostolicis viris authorē suum proferunt, vt multò posteriores, quae deni{que} quotidie instituuntur, tamen in eadem fide conspirantes, non minùs Apostolicae depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur pro consanguinitate Doctrinae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this place of <hi>Tertullian</hi> wee haue a playne Doctrine, that whatsoeuer the
<pb facs="tcp:176688:67"/> fathers haue spoke for succession of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, as a marke to make knowne the true church: by the same is to be restreined vnto those tymes that were nere vnto the Apostles. For of other churches hee saith, albeit they bring none of the Apostles or Apostolical men for there authours, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long after them: neuerthelesse agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them in faith and Doctrine, they are to be accompted Apostolical as well as the other, because of their alliance by Doctryne. The very woordes that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly goe before these which you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, do put the matter out of doubt, that this triall of succession is onely ment for such Churches as were nere the Apostles time. His woordes are these: <hi>Caeterùm si quae audent interserere se aetati Apostolicae, vt ideo videantur ab Apostolis traditae, quia sub Apostolis fuerunt, possimus dicere: Edāt ergo origines Ecclesiarum suarum, euoluant ordinem Episcoperum suorum, &amp;c.</hi> But if any dare intrude themselues into the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles tyme, that they should be accompted Apostolicall, because they were vnder the Apostles: we may say let those then shew
<pb facs="tcp:176688:67"/> the original of their Churches, let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the order and succession of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes. I hope nowe Syr that you doe plainely see, what little helpe you haue frō these authorities that are alledged by you: &amp; that you doe wel consider howe vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully they haue bene aduouched, what cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and paringe you haue made of them, and howe that ther is not one of your wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses brought to prooue your Churche to be Apostolical, if you had suffered him to tell out his tale, and not stopped his mouth in the middest of his speach: but woulde haue vtterly ouerthrowne your cause, and established ours which you labour to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe. And therefore I doe beseech you in the feare of God to looke well vnto it. Peruse the places againe, consider better of them, and marke the iudgements of god vpon you &amp; your cause, that your very wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses shoulde be wray you, euen those that you deliberatly &amp; of purpose haue picked out to speake for your purgation. If I might haue prescribed those fathers what to say against your cause, and for ours: I coulde haue deuised no better matter than
<pb facs="tcp:176688:68"/> they haue vttered, euē in the places by you alleaged. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith plainely that the trueth hath discended from the Apostles to his tyme without forgery: because the scriptures were faithfully deliuered vnto them: and because all their commentaries and expositions were warraunted by the Scriptures: You doe not warrant your expositions by Scriptures, but contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse will haue the Scriptures to haue warrant from your expositions: for you must geue the sense and meaninge thereof, because it is of and in it selfe, as you saye afterward, <hi>Mortua vox,</hi> a dead word.</p>
               <p>Hee saith in the other place, that those Bishoppes, that depart from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall succession of true doctrine, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they haue to say for their succession of person and place, are notwithstanding to bee suspect of Heresy or schisme.</p>
               <p>What neede was there to make menci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the trueth, as the principall succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that we shoulde be suspicious of those Bishops, that had no such succession from
<pb facs="tcp:176688:68"/> the Apostles: if the succession of the trueth be (as you say) kept and reserued in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall orderly succession of Bishoppes: if whersoeuer that succession bee of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the other of Doctrine bee vnsepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bounde thereunto. For if wheresoeuer there be this succession of Bishoppes, ther wee must looke vndoubtedly to haue the trueth, then is that of person, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal succession, and the other of trueth, but a companion, that wayteth and geueth dayly and dutifully attendance thereupon. If this bee so, then wee are first to inquire after the succession of persons, being assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there to finde the trueth: And in deede your proofes such as they be, are wholy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged for succession of person, belike if you coulde finde that, you woulde not greatly passe for finding the trueth. You are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to <hi>Irenaeus</hi> herein, who maketh succession of trueth, the principall succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. As for <hi>Tertull.</hi> hee affirmeth plainly, that the doctrine of the apostles wil cōfute them, whosoeuer shall bring a diuerse doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, albeit they alleage for thē successiō of
<pb facs="tcp:176688:69"/> persons as you doe from the Apostles: <hi>Ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa enim inquit doctrina eorum cum Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica comparata, ex diuersitate &amp; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietate sua pronunciabit, ne{que} Apostoli ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuius esse ne{que} Apostolici.</hi> Hee affirmeth likewise that the churches who were long after the Apostles tyme, are to trie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues Apostolical by their alliance w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the Apostles in doctrine. <hi>Ad hanc ita{que} formā prouocabūtur ab illis Ecclesiis, quae licet nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ex Apostolis vel Apostolicis authorem suum proferunt, vt multò posteriores: tamē in eadem fide conspirantes, non minùs. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicae deputantur pro consanguinitate do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinae.</hi> You see what helpe we haue for our religiō, out of your strongest houldes. We haue in the scriptures the authenticall let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Epistles of the Apostles, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge the summe of that Doctrine, which they taught in those Churches that they planted which are rightly called by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> the mother Churches. Wee haue the summe of that Doctrine left vs in wryting, which <hi>Paule</hi> taught at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> at <hi>Philippos,</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> where hee founded Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
<pb facs="tcp:176688:69"/> You should first haue warrāted your religiō by that doctrine, &amp; frō thence haue proceeded to let vs vnderstand, how that doctrine hath continued amongst you from time to time. You would beare the worlde in hand, that you deriue your doctrine frō the Apostles and auncient Churches, yet you shunne as rockes all triall by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and those mother Churches, where their Chaires were placed, and their owne doctrine faithfully vnder their owne hands and seales deliuered. Let vs first see how you doe agree with the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and then with those Bishops who haue succeeded them: how with the first &amp; mother Churches, and then with those lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter who haue beene planted after them. Let vs see you first knit vnto the heade, and then vnto the members. After your testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and allegations for succession, you adde these wordes: <hi>Now ye see that the true and verie Church of Christ is, which hath her succession of Bishops from the Apostles:</hi> Wherunto I answer that there is no eye so sharpe of sight, that
<pb facs="tcp:176688:70"/> cā discerne any such matter, by those proofs that you haue brought: but euery man that hath not his eyes closed vp, may see plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (by that light which your owne witnesse haue geuen vnto this cause) that succession of Bishops is no note nowe in these later tymes whereby to discerne the Churche.</p>
               <p>You inferre likwyse vpon such authorities as you haue aduouched, that the ancient state of the Churche through the worlde is the Apostles doctrine. I knowe you can haue no colour for any such collection, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you take liberty to chaung and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Est</hi> for <hi>&amp;,</hi> and <hi>&amp;</hi> for <hi>est,</hi> after your pleasure: that whereas <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith, <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitio vera est Apostolorum doctrina &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquus Ecclesiae status:</hi> You reade: <hi>Agnitio vera &amp; Apostolorum doctrina est antiquus Ecclesiae status.</hi> As for those printes and markes of the olde state of the Churche, which were in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time, I proued before that they where cleane worne out, and no token of them to bee seene among you: for your expositions are not legitimat by Scriptures, but laid vpon vs by vertue
<pb facs="tcp:176688:70"/> of the Churche, whereof you stil plead pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, howe vniust soeuer your title bee.</p>
               <p>You woulde gladly find out of these words. <hi>Certum charisma veritatis:</hi> The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of orders: which you say is receiued together with their Bishopriks: but the circumstāces of that place make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so plaine to be ment of the gift or grace of trueth, which hee calleth the principall succession, as no man that will vouchsafe to reade and compare it with that which goeth before and also followeth it, can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly bee brought to make a doubt thereof. From your holy orders which you woulde wring out of this place, you proceede I wil not say without order, I am sure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any occasion offered to the manner of ordayning Bishoppes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hich you say must be by the laying on of handes of former Bishoppes so ordeined, or otherwise they are not to bee obeyed.</p>
               <p>So that you secretly shoote at the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the church of Englād, that it is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnlawful &amp; not to bee obeyed, because our bishops w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> haue ordeined others, were
<pb facs="tcp:176688:71"/> not themselues ordeined of your Bishops, that were before them. Doe you say that no man is a lawfull Bishop, but he that is ordeined of another Bishoppe? If that be true thē I dare say and can plainly prooue, that your Bishops are vnlawfull Bishops,<note place="margin">Hieron. ad Euagr. Titus. 1. ver. 5.7.</note> and therefore not to be obeyed. For from the beginning (as <hi>Hierom</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth) there was no difference in the church betweene a bishoppe and a minister: but afterwarde when schismes grewe to be many and great in the Church, for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing thereof one was appointed to be aboue the rest, which had the name of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe proper vnto him, which before was common vnto all, as the Scripture declareth. In those first times therefore of schisme, those Bishoppes must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie be ordeined of others then bishoppes: because there were then no bishoppes in the Church, as now we doe speake of thē. And therefore by your owne reason, your owne bishops being as you affirme from the beginning, are illegitimate and not to be obeyed, because they were not ordeined of former Bishoppes: nowe that if they
<pb facs="tcp:176688:71"/> were not lawfully ordeined thē selues, thē could they not lawfully ordeyned others: for other title then they had them selues they could not geue vnto others. By this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptiō that you haue made of the lawfull ordeining &amp; creating of bishops, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whole broode of your bishoppes from the first vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the last, standeth illigitimate &amp; plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuicte of bastardie. We know and are assured by the truth of GOD his woorde, that it is lawfull for ministers of the word, to ordein them who are to labour in the ministerie of the woord: for thus we reade in the Epistle to <hi>Timothie. <hi>1. cap. 4.</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note>
                  <hi>Ne neglige illud donum quod datum est tibi per prophetiam cum impositione manuum praesbiterij.</hi> Now there is no man, howe ignorant soeuer he be of the Scripture, or of the Greek tongue in the which the newe testament was penned, if he haue any skill in the Latine: that wil deriue <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, non à presbyteris, sed ab Episcopis.</hi> You may perceiue thē that they were <hi>praes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteri</hi> and not <hi>Episcopi</hi> ministers or elders, and not bishops (as now we speake of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes) that laide handes vpon <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:176688:72"/> when hee was called to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of the woorde. You see therefore that at the ordeyning of <hi>Timothie</hi> they were <hi>presbyteri</hi> elders or Ministers of the woorde, which gaue this grace by the imposition of their hands, which you say can not bee geuen but by Bishoppes. Now if <hi>presbyteri</hi> Ministers of the word, may ordeyne other by impositiō of hands. thē I truste we shal haue you more fauora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hereafter to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Ministery here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. If we haue nothing els to saye for it, yet at the least because they who in these last tymes haue bene the instrumentes of God to reforme Religion, and haue ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned others to serue in the Ministery of the word and Sacramentes, were <hi>presbyteri:</hi> hauing from your Churche imposition of handes, whereby there is so great grace giuen as you saye.</p>
               <p>True it is that imposisition of handes was a consecration and putting a parte of men to serue in the Ministery of the woorde, by attending vpon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb facs="tcp:176688:72"/> exhortation, and doctrine: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge as the Apostle declareth in this fourth chapter of <hi>Timothie:</hi> for when hee hath willed <hi>Timothie</hi> to attend vpon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, exhortation, and doctrine, forthwith signifying that hee was called thereunto, and that it was his function to the end hee might therby the more bee touched with the matter, hee addeth these wordes: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect not that gift or function which was committed vnto thee by imposition of handes.</p>
               <p>This marke of that vocatiō which doeth consist in attending vpon exhortation and doctrine continued in your Churche, <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam cadauer verae vocationis,</hi> as it were a carkas of a true calling: for you attended not vpon the worde setting it foorth truely by exhortation and doctrine, which was the life of that calling: but found a greater gaine to get mony by, in attending vpō the sale of masses and pardons, hauing greate gaine not only by thē that were liuing: but also by those that were long ago departed:
<pb facs="tcp:176688:73"/> so that in verie deed there was nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining beside the corps of the true cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Vnto this carkas and corps of the true calling, it pleased the Lorde in that great mercie wherwith hee loued vs, when wee were enemies vnto him: now againe in these latter daies after so lōg want ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to breath in life &amp; vital spirites: geuing vnto diuerse who had no more beside the olde marke of that calling, not only giftes of knowledg to be able: but of zeale also to be willing &amp; boulde, euen whē the market of your Inuentions &amp; Traditions was the greatest to publishe the Gospel of God, &amp; to beate down your inuentions by doctrine &amp; exhortatiō out of the word: giuing foorth euidēt testimonies thereby, that they were the true &amp; lawful ministers of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>because they had the trueth and life of the Ministerie, which in your Church was wanting, in as much as they did attend vppon exhortation and doctrine, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the trueth of the woorde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto in the Primitiue Churche men were appointed by imposition of handes. You speake nothing here of that which is
<pb facs="tcp:176688:73"/> principall, that is of the election vnto that place and function after due examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had before, both of life and learning, without the which al your purest Canons account him as a Leyman, &amp; appoint grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous punishment for him that shall other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise ordeine him: but so you haue the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, you passe not for the bodie: so you may enioy the least of the accessaries, you can willingly want the principal.

               <p>TOuchinge the fourth noate of the churche, that it is catholique or vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall, if you set it against particularity, meaning that the churche is not bounde to any particular place or person we doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it as a certaine trueth: But if you wil haue the Churche alway discerned by the greater multitude, the scriptures will
<pb facs="tcp:176688:75"/> not suffer vs to ioyne with you in that. Your testimonies out of the Scriptures, as that of <hi>Isaie</hi> the seconde, and the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies next following out of the <hi>Psalmes:</hi> doe prooue that many people shall bee brought to the true knowledge &amp; worship of god. For the vniuersal note <hi>[al]</hi> is so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kē in the scriptures. And I am perswaded that you doe not thinke that all people and nacions in general shalbe brought to be of the true Churche: but as for comparison, whether that the number shalbe greater or lesse than they that are not brought to the faith, they doe make no mention therof.</p>
               <p>The other testimonies doe declare that the trueth shall come into many places, but whether those places shalbe moe or fewer than the reste, or whether the greater nū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the inhabitātes of those places shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be gayned by the trueth vnto God, they doe not speake any woorde thereof: yet I thinke that is the matter that you woulde willingly establishe hereby. Your last wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse out of the Gospel, if it bee graunted you that it is spoken of the church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, yet will it make nothing for vniuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb facs="tcp:176688:76"/> vnlesse any wil imagine, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is visible or not hidden, is thereby foorthwith made general &amp; common to al persons and places. You alleage a large testimony for this vniuersality, &amp; doe quote in your margent <hi>August. <hi>lib. 3. confes. cap.</hi> 8.</hi> Where there is no more of all you haue alleaged to bee founde, saue the first lyne, which is: <hi>Turpis enim omnis pars est suo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerso non congruens.</hi> Euery part is euill fauoured, that agreeth not with his whole. This Authority telleth vs what worketh the disgrace of a part, euen this not to bee agreeable to that whole wherof he is part: As for your purpose it is to prooue an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, that multitude is the beauty &amp; the right note of the Churche: howe that cā be prooued out of this place I leaue it to your better consideratiō, whē you shal haue marked those wordes y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> doe immediatly goe before this place. <hi>Quae autē cōtra mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res hominū sunt flagitiapro morū diuersitate vitanda sunt, vt pactū inter se ciuitatis aut gentis, consuetudine vel lege firmatū, nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la ciuis aut peregrini libidine violetur.</hi> I feare your Informer hath of purpose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed

               <p>The woordes are directed against one man, who differeth from al that are called Christians in any place. This would help you if you had to deale against a sect that had but one patron, or against a man that would be accompted a christian, and yet for al that in doctrine bee contrary to al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. It is to weake to stand against a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that sundrie coūtries, Prouinces &amp; Kingdomes doe imbrace. Before I had <hi>Augustine</hi> with a wrong direction, now I haue his name without any direction at al Such wordes as you haue set down heere are found in his booke <hi>contra Epistolam fundamenti,</hi> where you conceale that,<note place="margin">Aug. contra epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolam funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti cap. 4.</note> which vtterly ouerthroweth all the foure notes of your Churche, and proueth them to be altogither insufficient to make true proofe where the Churche is.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:176688:77"/>
               <p>These are the woordes that follow in that place. <hi>Apud vos autem vbi nihil horum est quod me iuuitet ac teneat, sola personat veritatis pollicitatio, quae quidem si tam ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesta monstratur, vt in dubium venire non possit, praeponenda est illis rebus omnibus quibus in Catholica teneor.</hi> But amonge you where there is none of these thinges (saith <hi>Augustine:</hi>) that maye houlde me, there soundeth the onely promise of trueth, which if it bee shewed so manifest that it can not come in doubt: it is to be preferred before all those thinges, by which I am houlden in a Catholique Church. Hee had spoken before of Vnitie and agreement of people, of authoritie begon with miracles, &amp; increased with charitie, and holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, of antiquity, and succession of Bishops from <hi>Peter</hi> vnto his tyme, &amp; also of vniuersality: and yet he professeth that the trueth when it is made manifest and playne, is to cary vs against them all. If the trueth bee boūd vnto Vnitie, successiō, &amp; vniuersalitie, so that these be the markes wherby we are directed to the true church, and therefore to the trueth, by what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb facs="tcp:176688:77"/> dare <hi>Augustine</hi> to put them a sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whom Almightie God hath ioyned togeather (as you thinke) to continue one for euer. For if they be neuer sundred, why maketh he a supposell of that that neuer happneth, especially dealing with them, that were perswaded that it was not so strange a thing, but that it might yea and had alredy hapned? Or why setteth he, the trueth in <hi>specie,</hi> that is: <hi>The trueth made open &amp; plainly manifested:</hi> against those markes of the Church: when as the trueth, whether in parables, playne speach, or howsoeuer, is neuer founde sundred from them as you thinke? Moreouer why doeth he trouble him selfe with comparing of thinges togeather, affirming that the one shall more perswade then the other: if it bee impossible for the one to perswade, but not for the other. For comparison is of those that bee like, but there is no resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaunce betweene a thing impossible, and that which may bee doone. Laste of all howe agree you with <hi>Augustine,</hi> that saith, <hi>The plaine and vndoubted trueth perswadeth more than them all:</hi> When
<pb facs="tcp:176688:78"/> as you are of opinion, not onely that the trueth can not be had plainly, but that it cannot be had at all, but in and by them. You see that <hi>Augustine</hi> in this place vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthroweth the markes and notes that you haue made of your Church, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs vnderstande that the trueth may bee sundred from all, euen from the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Bishoppes, which you make so great an account of: that (in your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) heauen and earth may sooner come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, then those two bee parted and put asunder. It standeth you vpon to make this breach vp againe, if it possibly can be performed of you, for it hath vndone al that you haue trauayled in al this time to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishe. It was not without cause therfore that <hi>Augustine</hi> both came in and went out so like a straunger, as no man coulde knowe (when once hee had made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraunce) where too haue him againe howe glad soeuer hee woulde haue beene, to haue spoken with him. But let it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that <hi>Augustine</hi> spoke of a matter that coulde not come to passe, when hee saide, that the trueth made playne and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
<pb facs="tcp:176688:78"/> was a note of the Churche to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before vnitie, succession vniuersality &amp;c. That which followeth wil declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom he obiecteth the name of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique: euen agaynst those heretiques, who when they woulde bee called Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, yet can but shewe one Churche or one house, where their religion is profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. For these are his words. The Church alone hath so obteined the name of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, that where as all Heretiques would be called Catholiques, yet when a straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger shall aske where men meete at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, none of the Heretiques dare shewe him either their Temple or their house. If <hi>Englande, Scotlande, Denmarke, Suetia, Saxony, Heluetia, Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tia, Vallis Tellina, Brunswicke, Rhene, Hessia, Wittenberge, Russia, Brande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge,</hi> with the great Cities through the whole Countrey of <hi>Germany</hi> could shew but one Church, one house, &amp; one prouince or litle Shire among them al, where their religion were professed, or if al these great kingdomes cōmon wealthes &amp; countreies
<pb facs="tcp:176688:79"/> coulde by some conuersion bee turned into one litle prouince, temple, or house, then might this authoritie, or that that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of <hi>Augustine,</hi> haue some colour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs. But since, that Gospell which wee professe, at the first did spreade it selfe abroade into infinite places, and was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally receiued, vntil the dominion of that man of sinne, the Pope: vnder whom for a long time it was greatly darkened, and now since the late reuiuing againe therof, hath greatly enlarged her dominion &amp; shut you out, not of some fewe houses or prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but out of a number of kingdomes, do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minions, common wealthes, &amp; countreys, daily getting ground of you (be your Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and persecution neuer so great) your authorities out of <hi>Augustine</hi> can stande you in no steede. As concerning the latter part of your last authoritie, which affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the Catholique Churche by the cleerenesse of one faith spreadeth out it self from the East vnto the West, yf it bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken so generally as the woordes seeme too giue out of it: it pulleth cleane frō you your title of [Catholique]. For you can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:176688:79"/> but that al the Greeke Churchs vtterly renounce the authoritie of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; the Churches that are scattered here and there throughout all <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> in like maner doe not acknowledge it. As for <hi>Europe</hi> you heard me euen now recite what kingdomes, common wealths and countreies in it, abhorreth the <hi>Pope</hi> and all his detestable enormities. And in those kingdomes and countries where the <hi>Pope</hi> is receiued, this I dare say, for you doe prooue it by fire &amp; fagot, that there is no countrey, not <hi>Italy</hi> it selfe excepted, where there are not great nūbers of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that from the bottome of their hartes doe detest the <hi>Pope.</hi> And therefore if you measure vniuersality by place and person, as you are wont to doe: taking that to bee vniuersall which is receiued in all places, and of all persons, you see that your religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commeth far short of a catholique reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. You close vp three lines in the ende closly togither with <hi>Augustine</hi> his words, as if they were not only spoken at one time &amp; with one mouth, but euen also with one breath. Wheras he hath not one such word
<pb facs="tcp:176688:80"/> there, it is wholy your owne application and conclusion, it is none of his. If a man woulde take suche libertie vnto him selfe, hee might soone beguile the ignorant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I coulde the better haue borne this without making any mention therof, yf I had not seene the like in you before, and therfore I cannot but admonish you. This place of <hi>Augustine</hi> doeth in deede make warre against the Family of loue, who bring in a religion that neuer was hearde of since the beginning of the worlde, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued publiquely in any one Prouince, or taught in any one Temple, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: As for those whom it pleaseth you to cal Puritanes, when you tel me what groūds, of religiō they hold dissēting from the truth, I wyl geue them warning to be in a readinesse to resist you. I knowe none in Englande that eyther woulde be called by that name, or deserue to bee called by it beside the Papist, and the Family of loue. For the Papists are so ouer pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in theyr owne iudgement, that they sell the very excrements and superfluitie of their woorkes vnto others: And as for the Family of loue, after that a
<pb facs="tcp:176688:80"/> fewe yeeres of theyr Apprentishyp be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, &amp; they begin to set vp for themselues, they are of opinion, it is no more possible for thē afterward to sinne, than is possible for light to become darkenesse. If those be the true marks of the church in that sence which you doe take them, I see no cause why the Scribes and Pharisees, might not iustly agaynst our Sauiour haue clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the title of the Church. For they were at great vnitie among them selues, so that their Churche might wel haue beene cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Vna:</hi> And they abounded in prayer, fasting, and almes, which you doe simply set downe without any addition, for the fruites of holynesse: and therefore theyr Churche was <hi>Sancta:</hi> Moreouer they sate in <hi>Moses</hi> seate, and succeeded him in the Chayre, and therfore they were iustly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled vnto succession: and theyr Churche lawfully called <hi>Prophetica:</hi> which was the same before Christe that <hi>Apostolica</hi> is nowe: and last of all the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber went with them agaynst Christe, and therfore theyr Church was <hi>Catholica.</hi> It is manifest thē that you haue saide nothing
<pb facs="tcp:176688:81"/> for your Church, which the scribes &amp; pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees might not say sor them selues. And if your notes were true, Christe Iesus could neuer haue preuayled against them, hauing the true notes of the Churche, and therfore being the true church, against the which nothing can preuaile. The notes that are giuen by the Apostles them selues of the Churche, and wherby they were led to acknowlege any people to be the church of God, were two in nūber: faith in Christ Iesus: and loue towardes his saintes: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is written by the apostle. <hi>We giue thankes vnto God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Colloss. 1.4.</note>
                  <hi>euen the father of our Lord Iesus Christ, alwaies praying for you, since wee heard of your faith in Christ Iesus, and of your loue toward al Saints.</hi> It appereth hereby, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle did acknowlege thē for mēbers of the Church, vsing them as brethren in giuing thankes to God, &amp; praiyng for them: after that these tokens of the Churche, too wit, faith in Christ Iesus, &amp; loue towards his Saintes, did appeare in them through the preaching of the Gospel.<note place="margin">Ephesi. cap. 1. ver. 15.</note> The same is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:176688:81"/> the same woordes. <hi>Therefore after I hearde of the fayth which you haue in the Lorde Iesus, and loue toward al the Saintes, I ceast not to geue thankes for you, making mencion alwayes of you in my prayers.</hi> And not onely the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but euen the verie same manner and forme of woordes, is vsed throughout his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, where he hath any occasion offered to touche the same.<note place="margin">1. Thes. 1.3.</note> As in the first epistle to the Thessalonians: and in the second also, and the first chapter.<note place="margin">ad Phile. 5.</note> In the Epistle to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon.</hi> In like maner he rehearseth these same two markes: of faith in Christ Iesus, and loue towardes all Saintes. These were marks that the Apostles were direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by to discerne of the Churche, they thought these sufficient causes to mooue them to thinke of others as their brethren, and the deare Children of God, when as they thorow the preaching of the woorde, were knitte vnto Christe by faith, and vnto his children that did serue him after that woorde, by loue and sincere affection of hearte and good will towardes them. These markes that are noted as the tokens
<pb facs="tcp:176688:82"/> of GOD his children in those firste and mother Churches, can not bee founde with you. For the worde soundeth not among you, which shoulde discouer by the sight of that which the Lord in iustice doth require, so great imperfection to be in vs: &amp; withal so much mercie to bee in Christ, for men that are confoūded in themselues: as would prouoke vs by faith to repose our selues vpon him and his mercies. As for the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of your Churche, it so vpholdeth the aptnesse add inclination of man to doe wel, the liberty and freedome of his will, that he cannot come to the sight and knowledge of any so greate want as might sende him hungerly after Christ, and his mercies, to cleaue therevnto by faith: besides that, it doeth so fearefully geue out the affection &amp; disposition of this our mediatour, as if a man coulde not come to the speache of him in the least matter, before halfe the courte of heauen were mooued for that matter, in his behalfe, and shoulde befreend him therein, which turneth our affection &amp; affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, comfort &amp; confidence rather towarde them, then towardes him. Wherevpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:176688:82"/> man may cleerely see and vnderstande, that this Churche of yours is not knit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ by faith, And howe it is affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towardes his Saintes who are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and borne agayne by the immortal seed of the worde, all the worlde may iudge, and their blood that hath beene so plentifully spilt, hath left in euery kingdome and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie sufficient witnesses thereof agaynst you.</p>

               <p>YOu labour earnestly for succession, &amp; therefore doe geue the attempt once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to proue, that true faith and doctrine hath bene preserued and kept from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, first by traditiō, &amp; then by writing &amp; tradition, in a continual succession of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes &amp; Priestes. You alleage for proofe of this, that which is writtē by the Apostle to the <hi>Thessalonians: State &amp; tenete traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones quas didicistis siue per sermonē siue per
<pb facs="tcp:176688:84"/> epistolam nostram:</hi> Keepe suche things as you haue learned, eyther by our woorde, or by our writing: he exhorteth thē to obserue whatsoeuer the Apostles had mooued them vnto, either in their sermons, or by their letters: but he promiseth not the Churche, that there shalbee suche fidelitie in all who are to succeede them, that a man may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depende vppon their woordes and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges: and this is the matter that you haue taken in hande to prooue. If you coulde haue made the Apostle speake thus: <hi>Tenete traditiones quas discetis siue per ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monem, siue per epistolam, non a nobis tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm, verumetiam a succedentibus nobis E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopis quibuscunque:</hi> It woulde haue made somethinge for your succession. If you had but entred into the least considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that possibly might bee of the matter, setting affection aside, you shoulde soone haue discerned, that it was impossible to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishe a necessitie binding all times to come: by a verbe that noteth only the time past: Keepe those things (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) which you haue learned. And no lesse absurde, to inferre a succession,
<pb facs="tcp:176688:84"/> from wordes that mencion those onely who are in present possession: keepe those thinges saith he, which you haue learned of vs, not that which you shal learne of our successours. I do greatly meruel that euer you could be brought to build a matter of so great importaunce in your iudgement, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon so feeble a foundation. For before this foundation shalbe able to beate any suche weight as you haue layde vppon it, these grauntes must freely bee geuen vnto you. First that an exhortation to doe a thing, necessarily inferreth that thing both to haue bene done by them that were so exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; by al that haue euer come after them: for vpon Paule his exhortatiō to the <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians,</hi> that they shoulde keepe suche thinges as he had taught them eyther by worde or writing: you gather a continuall practise to haue bene made of those things by them, and all that haue come after them. You might as probably reason thus, that because A Preacher once gaue exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to his Parishioners too beware of wrath, and to mainteine loue and concerd:
<pb facs="tcp:176688:85"/> Therefore you are sure there shall neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny discord be hearde of in that towne after that day, vnto the ende of the worlde. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly this must bee graunted vnto you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that an exhortation made indifferently to all the faithfull people of <hi>Thessalonia:</hi> commaundeth a practise thereof to By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes and Priestes onely. For the Apostle arming the church of <hi>Thessalonia</hi> against Antichrist his forcible delusions, which the wicked shalbe geuen vp to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, because they haue refused the loue of the trueth: willeth not one sort of them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, but al of them generally, stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to imbrace and holde fast those instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they had receyued from him and the Apostles, eyther by woorde or writing. Thirdly, that woordes spoken without any limitation at all, are onely iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified in them, who doe in order succeede one another: for you will haue these traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to bee kept in a continuall successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Byshoppes and Priestes onely. Fourthly, that woordes mencioning thinges deliuered, and the maner how they
<pb facs="tcp:176688:85"/> are deliuered, doe necessarily inferre, howe they haue and shallbee preserued: for the Apostle telleth them that they are to keepe such thinges as haue bene deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto them, whether it were by word or by writing: but hee bindeth them not to any certaine manner of keeping of thē, and much lesse to that manner, which he had deliuered them by: as if it shoulde bee vnlawfull to keepe any of that in writing, for the helpe of their memories: which hee had deliuered onely in preaching. Now out of woordes that declare the manner of deliuering, you necessarily will conclude the manner of keeping. If al these things were graunted vnto you, you might haue some colour for that matter which you are about to prooue: but as the place is of it selfe, I doe not remember that euer I hearde, so much weight to haue bene laid vpon so weake a body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Traditions</hi> (as the Apostle speaketh of them) are deliuered partly by writing, and partly by woorde of mouth: so that tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is affected towardes the writtē woord of God, as the generall or vniuersall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb facs="tcp:176688:86"/> his particular: you make them as two seuerall members, one diuerse from an other. Consider therefore well where you haue receiued this distinction, you may see that you haue it not from the Apostle, for he distinguisheth otherwyse. I woulde willingly learne, how you can proue, that matters of faith haue beene kept partly in tradition, (as you say) from the beginning. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith otherwyse, in the first Chapter of his thirde booke, as you hearde before:<note place="margin">Irenaeus.</note>
                  <hi>Non per alios dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onē salutis nostrae cognouimus quàm per eos, per quos Euangelium peruenit ad nos, quod quidem tunc praeconiauerunt, postea per Dei voluntatem in scripturis nobis tradiderunt: fundamentum fidei nostrae futurum.</hi> We knowe not our saluation by any other, then those by whome the Gospel hath come vnto vs, which then they preached, and afterwarde by the will of God left it in wryting, to be the piller of our faith. He saith that our faith must leane vpon that which the Apostles first preached, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde by the will of God, left in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
<pb facs="tcp:176688:86"/> and not as you woulde haue it, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon that, and partly vpon tradition.</p>
               <p>You bring another testimony out of the Epistle to the <hi>Corinthes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Corint. 2.</note> where the Apostle promiseth that he will order other thinges, when hee cometh: to prooue that the true faith hath beene partly keept in tradition. If they bee matters of faith which the Apostle speaketh of, in that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: tell vs what they bee: if they bee no matters of Faith, but outward orders, then you speake not to the matter, which you haue taken in hande. For wee deny not, but the Churche may order outward thinges, as shalbee thought most meete to edify with all.</p>
               <p>That the Sabboth day is chaunged frō the Saterday vnto Sonday: that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptisme is more often admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred thē it was in the primitiue church: that we are not restreined now <hi>à suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to &amp; sanguine:</hi> Maketh nothing against vs: who knowe and professe, that outwarde thinges of that nature that these bee of, may be reteyned or refused by the churche,
<pb facs="tcp:176688:87"/> as they shall perceiue them tend to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, or otherwyse. Looke you wel vnto it, whoe are of opinion, and doe professe, that the Apostles doctrine &amp; traditions, are faithfully reserued, in a perpetuall succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Bishoppes, and deliuered from one to another. How faithfully doe you reserue them, when you take liberty as you doe professe, to chaunge them? I say it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth you vpon, to looke how you chaunge any of their traditions, whoe take vpon you to bee faithfull reseruers of the same, and men that are put in trust to deliuer them ouer vnto their posterity. If any man shall consider aduisedly, howe your proofes doe confirme in this place, the matter that you haue taken in hande to prooue: hee shall hardly get them hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither.</p>
               <p>You say we are discharged of our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence from strangled and blood, not by Scripture: but by the authoritie of the Churche: who saith now in her generall councelles, as then shee did: <hi>Visum est spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritui Sancto &amp; nobis:</hi> let me aske you this
<pb facs="tcp:176688:87"/> question, how it cometh to passe that of one thing, the Churche shoulde say: <hi>Visum est spiritui Sancto &amp; nobis:</hi> And agayne of the same thing: <hi>Non visum est spiritui San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto, &amp; nobis:</hi> but by the Scripture, which telleth vs, that such outwarde thinges are to be done and left vndone: as they shalbee thought to edifie our brethren or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse. So that to maintayne peace and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, betweene the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Iewes</hi> who were so perswaded of Moses lawe, it was expedient for a tyme during this their persuasion, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> should absteyne from their liberty: but after that the <hi>Iewes</hi> were perswaded, that the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies must geue place to Christ and his Gospel, it was not expedient they should absteyne from their liberty any longer, neither did that rule of the Scriptures, which restrayneth things lawfull of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, vnto that which is expedient: any longer binde them. The Churche said in that councell. <hi>Visum est spiritui Sancto &amp; nobis, ne quid amplius imponeremus vobis oneris, quàm haec necessaria:</hi> After they had debated it by the Scriptures that
<pb facs="tcp:176688:88"/> Moses lawe, was not necessarily to be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> so that the reason why they say it seemes good vnto the holy Ghost and vs, is because they had learned by the Scriptures, which are the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges of the Holy Ghoste: that the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> were free, from the bondage of the ceremoniall lawe.</p>
               <p>The olde way that the Prophet willeth them to inquire after, is that way, which is described in his woorde, as appeareth in the nyententh Verse of that Chapter, which you haue alleaged. If you woulde inquyre after that waye, these controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies betweene you and vs, woulde soon be at an end.</p>

               <p>Now to prooue that lawfull succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Bishoppes and Priestes ought to bee hearde and followed, which is the thing that continueth the trueth, which
<pb facs="tcp:176688:88"/> was receiued in the beginning, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, to continue for euery age to the end of the same: I wil bring forth examples out of the very Scriptures. As first: Cain ought to haue obeyed Adam, to haue remayned with Seth, &amp; not to haue constituted a newe company, in such sort, that there shoulde bee one Citie of the children of Men, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the children of God. Nemrod ought to haue kept himselfe in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Seth, continued by Noe, and not to haue made himselfe a Prince by force, by which occasion, the Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bee abandoned. Ismael and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau, shoulde haue tarried in the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and not haue suffered their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring the Agarenes and Edomites, to leaue the olde Religion of Abraham Isaac and Iacob. Core, Dathan, and Abiram, shoulde not haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken, the succession of Leui and of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. Ieroboam shoulde not haue forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Moses chaire.</p>
               <p>Manasses the brother of Iaddus,<note place="margin">Ioseph. lib. in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiqui. cap. 8.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:176688:89"/> shoulde not haue forsaken the same suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and haue gone to builde a newe temple,<note place="margin">Iosep. de bello. Iudaico lib. 7. cap. 30.</note> in the mount Garrizim. Onias shoulde not haue forsaken the knowen succession at Ierusalem, and haue built a Temple in Egypt. The Samaritans shoulde not haue sacrificed but only in Ierusalem. Then Christ comming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prophesies of the saide lawe ended that succession and began a newe, from the which beginning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ende of the worlde, no man whatsoeuer he be, ought to forsake that ordinary succession that then began, but if he will doe well, must keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe therein vntill Christ come againe. These of the primitiue Churche, kept themselues with in the said succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as Dionysius Saint Paule his schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Policarpus Saint Iohn the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list his scholler, Ignatius, Clemens, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Abdias, and diuerse others. Nowe from this succession departed Marcion, Arius, Eunomius, Nestorius, Pelagius, Eutiches, with many others. Then in the
<pb facs="tcp:176688:89"/> said continued succession followed S. Basill, Saint Augustine, Saint Ambrose, Chrysostome, Tertullian, Saint Ierome, and many others.

               <p>IF you meane by lawful successiō, those who shall succeed in the principall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession: that is the succession of trueth, there is no question of that, but such are to bee heard, as doe bring the trueth of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Doctrine with them: but if you doe binde the trueth to persons, who haue suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Apostles in place, you knowe what hath bene prooued against this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niō before, in your third note of the church, wherunto I referre you. You neuer reade that <hi>Cain, Nemrod, Ismael, Esau, Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> professed a newe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and a diuerse worship of God from the rest: the scripture chargeth them with no such matter, but with corrupt lyfe and wicked conuersation: You contend for doctrine and religion to keepe that with in a succession of Bishoppes and Priests, and to charge them who depart from that succession, with corruption in religion. To what ende then serueth this number and assembly of men, corrupt in lyfe, but not touched with heresie, vnlesse you thinke
<pb facs="tcp:176688:90"/> that whosoeuer is corrupt in life, maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by and by a false and corrupt religiō: and maketh a publique departure from the trueth: either else you had bene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that this nomber woulde haue made me afraid, once to haue aduentured, the trial of their strengths? Let it be graū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that all these men here seuerally set downe and noted, as departers from the true succession: haue mayteyned Idolatry, and erected a false worshippe of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the trueth and true profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: What can you gather here vpon, but that it is not lawful to departe from those who vphold and maintayne true religion? Now whether you or wee bee the mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyners of the trueth that is the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, and therefore you may geue these men good leaue to returne from whence they came, for any helpe that you are lyke to haue from them. It may bee if they were better examined, that they woulde say and speake greatly against you: for <hi>Cain</hi> a wicked man, had noe bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe nor mercye for all his succession,
<pb facs="tcp:176688:91"/> albeit the birthright was his, and therfore the Priesthoode apperteyned vnto him by lawful succession. Ismael the elder, and therefore a lawfull successor in the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, yet a wicked member, and left vnto posteritie no tradition but of persecution. <hi>Esau</hi> the elder and therfore in the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Priesthoode, but yet hated of the Lord, and one who reserued fewe good traditions, that euer I coulde reade of to posteritie. <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> lawfully intituled vnto the office of the Priesthoode: the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are deliuered vnto posterity from them, are, that they were ranke rebelles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord, and against Moses his annoynted. Wee are ready to prooue, that the Euangelist noteth your Churche,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 2.</note> and that you are they who haue departed from the Apostles, and the auncient chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: and for proofe of this, wee appeale not onely vnto the writinges of the Holy Ghost, the Canonicall Scriptures: but also vnto that testimony, which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> before hath geuen of true knowledge, and of the state of the auncient Churche how
<pb facs="tcp:176688:91"/> to discerne it, and by what markes: and therefore wee say with <hi>Augustine</hi> against you: <hi>Exire non est sanae Doctrinae.</hi> And yet for al that it is not simply and without respect true, for if the Doctrine bee not sounde, it is as lawfull to departe from it, as it is vnlawful, to go from that which is good. So that to departe from any Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, is not otherwyse lawfull or vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: but according as the Doctryne it selfe is good or bad, from the which hee doeth depart. All of these were wicked members, and yet within the priuiledge of this succession, which you woulde make such a defence against corruption, as that a man needed not to feare any more, if once hee had got that sanctuary vpon his backe. Moreouer the greatest euilles that they are blamed for in the Scriptures, we are committed of them, before they left the society of the Churche, and children of God: whyle yet they were within the succession, howsoeuer you woulde seeme to perswade vs, that they neuer departed from goodnesse, before they had taken
<pb facs="tcp:176688:92"/> their leaue of succession. You affirme out of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that the order in the olde lawe, was a type and figure of that, which shoulde bee in the trueth vnder Christ, and therefore as the trueth was ioyned with the succession then, so is it nowe: but then (say I) it was not alwayes ioyned with the succession of Priestes, and therefore it is not to bee holden for a trueth, that now it shoulde bee so. And thus I prooue that in the olde lawe, the trueth wēt not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with succession. In the Churche of Israell, the ordinare succession of Priests was interrupted and broken of, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the first booke of the Kinges:<note place="margin">1. Reg. cap. 12.31 cap. 19.18.</note> and yet there was a Churche and great nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of faithfull people, that kept the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Doctrine, and neuer bowed their knees vnto <hi>Baal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may hereby plainely perceiue, that the trueth and purity of the worshippe of God, hath bene reserued: when yet the lawfull and ordinary succession of Priests failed. And the contrary is as plaine also, that there hath beene an ordinary and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:176688:92"/> succession of Priestes: when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the trueth was banished, &amp; most grosse errours receiued. For at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in the Reigne of the Kinge <hi>Achaz,</hi> there was an outwarde and visible succession of Priestes, yet the temple of God was shut vp, and <hi>Vrias</hi> the Priest, at the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Kinge, did publiquely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the worshippe of God, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>2. Chronic. cap. 28.24.</hi> and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke of the Kinges <hi>cap. <hi>16.15.16.</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Chroni. 28.24. 2. Reg. 16.15.16</note> And in lyke manner at the comminge of Christ, there was at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry succession, for they succeeded Moses and sate in his seate: &amp; yet for al that, their doctrine most corrupt, and the true church warned oftentymes by our sauiour Christ, to take heede of the leauen of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who had the ordinary suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession from Moses. You may therefore plainely see, that before Christ in the olde lawe, ther was purity of doctrine, without ordinary and visible succession of Priests, and likewyse ordinary and outwarde suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, without sincerity of Doctrine.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:176688:93"/>
               <p>Wherupon I doe conclude w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that because the order of the Churche in the olde lawe, was a type of the state in the newe lawe vnder Christ: that trueth of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, is not nowe bounde to an ordinary succession of Bishoppes. And if in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment of that people, when all thinges were so visible and outwarde, for the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of them, (the manner it selfe of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe not excepted:) there was interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of visible and ordinary succession: and the promise of succession was iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to bee but with condition, so long as they did obserue the lawe of God: howe much more in this tyme, when the worshippe of God is not so externall, but inwarde in spirit and trueth, will the Lorde not bee bounde vnto succession, when there shallbee a manifest defection, and falling away from the obedience of his woord. And you can not bee ignorant, that there is in the newe Testament,<note place="margin">2. Thessa. 2.</note> a plaine foretelling of a generall defection, which can no more stand, with a continual ordinary succession, then can Christ with Antichrist. And least any man shoulde
<pb facs="tcp:176688:93"/> imagine, that the Apostle doth but speake of some particular declining of this or that Church: the circumstances of the text, doe so set it foorth: as they doe leaue no doubt in the matter. For it is saide indefinitely, that he shall sit in the temple of God, &amp; not with any restraint, that he shall sit in this or that temple, Church or place. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, it is saide, that his comming shall be with all power, that all may receiue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which haue not beleued the trueth: so that the iudgement is not to come parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularlie vpon some one particular Churche or place, but generally vppon all that haue not beleeued and loued the trueth. And if succession haue suche priuiledges with it: that there is no danger of deceiuable doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, where it can be iustified to continue, why should not the Greeke Churches, as wel be beleeued for the trueth of their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, being able to deriue their succession from the Apostles, as well as you. If suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession haue in it such a blessing, in sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out it selfe without interruption, how happeneth it, that the Churches planted at <hi>Antioch, Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Corinth &amp;c.</hi> haue
<pb facs="tcp:176688:94"/> felt no greater benifite by it? those can truly say, that the Apostles planted them &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Bishops ouer them. If succession then be so fruitefull in it selfe, what reason can bee rendred, why it should not take their, which may not be giuen in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, why it may likewise bee barren with you? They that shall reade the Prophetes with any diligence, and conscience to bee instructed in the state of the Church before Christ, and vnder the law: shall soone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue howe farre it is from the trueth, to take warrant from thence to binde the true faith &amp; doctrine to a continual succession of priests. For thus saith <hi>Ierem.</hi> of the priests in his time:<note place="margin">Ieremy. 2.</note>
                  <hi>The Priests saide not: Where is the Lord? &amp; they that should minister the lawe knew me not: the pastors also offēded against me, &amp; the Prophets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied in Baall. Ezechiel</hi> likewise tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, what the Prophetes were who taught the people in his time.<note place="margin">Ezech. 13.</note>
                  <hi>O Israel</hi> (saith hee) <hi>thy Prophetes are like Foxes in the waste places, they haue seene va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and lying diuination, saying the Lorde saieth it, and the Lorde hath not
<pb facs="tcp:176688:94"/> sent them, therefore thus saith the Lord, because you haue spoken vanitie, and seene lyes, therefore beholde I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you.</hi> Letting passe the time of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> when all thinges were most cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in Religion: I will conclude with <hi>Malachie,</hi> touching the ordinary state of the Priestes in his time.<note place="margin">Malach. 2.</note>
                  <hi>The Priestes lippes</hi> (sayth <hi>Malachie) shoulde preserue knowledge, and they should seeke the lawe at his mouth. But yee are gone out of the way, you haue caused many to fall by the lawe, yee haue broken the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt of Leuy, sayth the Lord of hostes, therefore haue I also made you to bee despised, and vile before all people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may see what a daungerous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine it is, to tye the trueth vnto a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Priests: and that if a man would so haue doone vnder the lawe, he should haue giuen sentence againste the Prophetes that were extraordynarily raysed vppe, to reforme bothe Priestes and people, with those Priestes and Prophetes, who had their office by orderly and ordinary suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
<pb facs="tcp:176688:95"/> &amp; yet were seducers of the people. I doe therefore conclude with <hi>Ambrose</hi> against you, seing the order and state of the olde law was the type of the new: &amp; in the olde Testament, the Priests who had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of place and function, somtime did leaue the trueth &amp; imbraced pestilent doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: that therefore succession nowe is no certaine marke, whereby a man may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be sure to be directed vnto the truth. You haue hitherto contended for a successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on continuall and without interruption from the Apostles, to haue remained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, as the safest treasure house of of the trueth: but this succession without interruption, you can not finde as yet: I pray you giue me leaue in a few words to try, not whether you haue a succession with out interruption, but whether you haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny succession at all from the Apostles.</p>
               <p>The charge and office of the Apostles, is declared in the Gospel after Sainte <hi>Matthewe.</hi>

For who haue kept the register of those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, which men haue deposed against you? Haue not you your selues, against whom they were vttered, had the custodie of them?

<pb facs="tcp:176688:100"/> who can and often doeth reserue, and bring light out of the middest of darkenesse it selfe? Moreouer, what and if they who did espie it, had no knowledge by writing, to discrie it?

                  <hi>Alios ita lego, vt quantalibet sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate doctrina{que} praepolleant, non ideo verum putem quia ipsi ita senserunt: sed quia mihi vel per illos authores canonicos, vel probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liratione, quod à vero nō abhorreat persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere potuerint. <hi>Augustine</hi>
                  </hi> will haue no man carie matters of Religion away, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der learning or holinesse of life, further then he can make good his iudgement by the canonicall scriptures. And you haue heard before, that fathers haue sent vs from their owne priuate iudgement: and from their councels and common iudgements in publike assemblies: vnto the scriptures, as vnto a more sure and certaine rule.</p>
               <p>Your next demaund is the same in effect w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> these, &amp; therfore one answere may suffice both. For if those holy fathers assēbled in a councel, haue established any thing against
<pb facs="tcp:176688:105"/> the trueth, as some haue done, &amp; bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled of those councels that followed, thē should he that followed them, haue leaned more to the doctrine of men, then an other man, who following his owne iudgement, had ioyned with the scriptures, and yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed from all of them.</p>
               <p>You demaund a reason why you should beleeue M. <hi>Caluine</hi> and those that are of his iudgement, rather then M. <hi>Luther</hi> and those who imbrace his iudgement: the one beeing as well learned as the other: clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the spirit of God, aswel as the other: as able to confere places of Scripture to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to iudge thereof, as the other: I aunswere, that touching the matter of controuersie betwene them, you should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beleeue him then the other, who iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth his opinion by the Scriptures, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the other: As for their habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie we are to measure it by the effect, and therefore to iudge and affirme that he who doeth more aptly and truely conferre pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture togither, indeede is more able thervnto. If you would gather heere vpon, that conferring of places to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb facs="tcp:176688:106"/> in Scripture, is not the right way to come to true knowledge, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to agreement in the trueth, when men are at variance, because these two v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this conference of scriptures haue not for all that agreed aboute the meaning of some scriptures: then I answere, that the leaning vnto the iudgements of the doctors and the fathers, is not the best way in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies to fall vnto agreement, and to find out the trueth: because <hi>Ierome</hi> &amp; <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> contending about a place of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Epistle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August. Epist. 19</note> can not agree whether <hi>Paul</hi> did truely &amp; iustly reproue <hi>Peter,</hi> or that he did but dissemble a reprehending of him. <hi>Ierom</hi> alleaged for his exposition, the iudgement of seuen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to wit, <hi>Ladodicenus, Alexander, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen, Didimus, Eusebius, Theodorus,</hi> and <hi>Ioannes</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople. Augustine</hi> alledged for the warrant of his exposition, onely <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe if because Maister <hi>Luther</hi> and Maister <hi>Caluine</hi> can not agree vppon the true meaning of one place of Scripture, by conferring of Scriptures, you will
<pb facs="tcp:176688:106"/> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reiect the Scriptures, as no suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent meanes to come to the knowledge of the trueth, or to decide controuersies in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by them by the same reason a man may reiect the authoritie of the fathers, because <hi>Ierome</hi> &amp; <hi>Augustine</hi> proceeding by their iudgementes to finde out the trueth, haue not for all that fallen vnto an agreement, but remained stil deuided in opinion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the true meaning of that place. And by the same reason likewise, a man may reiect councels, as not sufficient to dicide controuersies in Religion, &amp; to bring men to knowledge of the trueth, because you, <hi>Thomists</hi> contending with your <hi>Scotistes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lo. Viues in Aug. de Ciui. Dei. Cap. 26.</note> whether y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> were conceiued in sin or no, coulde not be brought to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the authoritie of the councell of <hi>Basil,</hi> alleged by the <hi>Scotists</hi> for the defēce of their opinion, and making so plaine for them, as possiblie could be expressed.</p>
               <p>To conclude this matter, if you woulde haue a reason why Maister <hi>Luther</hi> and Maister <hi>Caluine</hi> by conferring of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe not yet for all that agree vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Exposition of some Scripture,
<pb facs="tcp:176688:107"/> this may be rendred: the Lorde wil not be bound to reueale all trueth, vnto all of his seruaunts: but will haue great giftes and graces, not to bee without some want ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in knowledge, or otherwise: that wee should not thinke of men, aboue that which is meete, but that he who will glory may glory in the Lord.</p>
               <p>You demaund whether it bee meete for all men to iudge vpon the Scriptures: I answeare, it is meete for all the children of God, to haue knowledge and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the word of God, and by it to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne betweene light and darkenesse, good and euil: for it is written in the Gospel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 20.4.</note> that the sheepe and flock of Christe will followe the true Sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde, because they knowe his voice, but will not followe a straunger, because they knowe not the voice of a straunger. If they had no discretion nor iudgement in the worde, why should they not as readily followe the voice of a straunger and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, as the voice of the true shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard. And if they be not meet to iudge vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scriptures, then are they as meete
<pb facs="tcp:176688:107"/> to followe the voice of a straunger, as the voice of the true sheepeheard: yet the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sayth, that they will not followe the voyce of a straunger, because they knowe it not. One thing that moueth you to think that all men are not meete to iudge of the scriptures, is, because S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> his brother <hi>Paule</hi> writeth many things hard to be vnderstod, which the vnlearned &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable do peruert, as they do the other scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their own destruction. This place telleth vs, that the vngodly are not meet to iudge of the scriptures. For he speaketh of such vnlearned, as are with al vnstable and vngodly, who receiue no more harme by those hard matters, that are handled in the scriptures, then by the most plaine &amp; easiest pointes of all. For hee saith that they doe peruert the reste of the scriptures, to their owne destruction as wel as those. So that the daunger is in the man, and not in the scripture: vnlesse peraduenture you think, that through out all the scripture there is great difficultie &amp; hardenesse for any man to conceiue, a right iudgement thereof. Which opinion the whole Scriptures doe
<pb facs="tcp:176688:108"/> directly stand against, for thus do we reade in the <hi>Prouerbs:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">prou. 8.</note>
                  <hi>All the wordes of my mouth are righteous, there is no fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes in thē, they are all plain to him that will vnderstand, &amp; straight to them that would finde knowledge.</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the <hi>2.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 2.</note> Chap. of the same boke it is written thus: <hi>If thou callest after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp; criest for vnderstanding, if thou seekest her as siluer, &amp; searchest for her, as for treasures, thē shalt thou vnderstād the feare of the Lord, &amp; finde the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</hi> And <hi>Paule</hi> affirmeth such cleerenes to be in the gospel,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> that he is not affcaid to say, if it be yet hid from them, the god of this world hath blinded their minds and closed vp their eyes: as if otherwise it were impossible for so great &amp; cleere light as that is, not to shew it self manifest &amp; eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vnto them. To return againe vnto the place, you say y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> writeth many things hard to be vnderstode, which is not so, for he speaketh but of some things. The speach of peruerting doth clere the matter it self frō all suspiciō, &amp; doth charge peruerter only. The vnlearned also chalēged not simply in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> respect, but w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> addition of instability &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines ioyned therunto, <hi>Which the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:176688:108"/> (saith the Apostle) <hi>&amp; vnstable do peruert:</hi> doth not foretel vs of danger to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other vnlerned, thē those who as they are vnlearned, so likewise are they vnstable &amp; vngodly withal. Last of all the admonition that followeth perswading not to haue no dealing w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the scriptures, as matters that were so hard, as that they could not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstode: but to take heede that they be not pluckt away by the error of the wicked &amp; fal from their own stedfastnesse: declareth that the whole danger is in the persons, &amp; not in the scriptures. And no maruel if the wicked peruertthe scriptures frō their true meaning: for as no mā knoweth the things of a man, saue the spirit of man, w<seg rend="sup">c</seg> is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.12.</note> euen so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God, which the vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>godly are destitute off. But those y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> are the childrē of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> witnesseth haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued spirit of God, wherby they knowe the things that are giuen thē of God. For the spirit searcheth all things, yea euen the deep things of God. An other thing y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you think, that al mē are not meete to iudge of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scriptures, is as you say, for that when certain would necessarily haue vrged circūcision, &amp; <hi>Moses</hi> law vpon y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Gentiles, the
<pb facs="tcp:176688:109"/> Apostles &amp; elders meete togither to consider of this matter, so that you gather heerevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it belongeth onely vnto the Church as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together in a councell, to iudge of matters of faith and religion, and the rest alwaies bound without any question of the matter, to obey. It is a very slender argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to say, the church assembled together doth giue iudgement of matters of faith &amp; religion that be in controuersie: &amp; therefore the true members of that Church, are not meete to discerne of the scriptures, neither can truely discerne of those controuersies. You might as well say, that the man who hath seene with his eyes a theefe stealing, and hath taken him with the manner, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not for all that truely discerne, whether it be theft and he a Theefe or no: because the Country meeteth afterwarde at the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to try the matter. <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> knewe the trueth of the matter and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against them, that woulde necessarylie vrge <hi>Moses</hi> lawe: before the Apostles and Elders did meete about it. They were of the same iudgement before, that they were after, as it appeareth in the same chapter,
<pb facs="tcp:176688:109"/> albeit they thought men would bee better satisfied, if the authoritie &amp; sentence of the Churche were had therein, and therfore went they not as doubting of the trueth in them selues, but as perswading others of that whiche they knowe was trueth. I do maruayle that you dare saye that those men, who vrged <hi>Moses</hi> law, &amp; saide to the Gentiles, <hi>Except ye be circūcised after the maner of Moses, yee cannot bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:</hi> had more Scriptures to alleage for them, then the Apostles and Elders had, because the new law was then vnwritten? What one place of Scripture can you bring, not only that the Gentiles, but that the Iewes them selues, to whom the law was geuen, coulde not haue beene saued: yf they had immediatly after Christe his ascention, lefte of Circumcision and the Ceremoniall lawe? The necessitie of the Ceremoniall lawe did not lye vppon the Iewes after Christe, the vsage of it for a time, was but for the weakenesse of some, &amp; that ceremonies appointed of the Lorde, myght as (<hi>Augustine</hi> sayth) not without honour bee had vnto the graue.
<pb facs="tcp:176688:110"/> You say also with like vntrueth of speach, that they as iudges without Scriptures, ordered this matter: when as it appeareth plainely in that same Chapter, that <hi>Saint Iames</hi> prooueth the callyng of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, out of the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon concludeth, that seeing they were turned vnto God without <hi>Moses</hi> law, they not obseruyng it, they were not nowe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily to be troubled with it. Makyng the Lorde his dealyng in shewyng mercy vppon them, and turning them vnto him, when as yet they were without it: as a sufficient reason to induce them, that they were not to bee troubled with it, and much lesse vnder payne of damnation too bee bounde to the obseruation thereof.</p>
               <p>You require who were iudges of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith and religion, the Scriptures, or men, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> and so <hi>800</hi> yeeres after Christe his ascention. I doe aunsweare that men did iudge of matters of faith and religion, but not otherwyse then by the Scriptures: and as they were directed from them, as wee reade in the <hi>17</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomy: And thou shalt
<pb facs="tcp:176688:110"/> come vnto the Priestes of the Leuites &amp; vnto the iudge that shal be in those daies, and aske, and they shal shew thee the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of iudgement, and thou shalt doe according to the thing that they of that place shal shew thee, according too the law which they shal teach thee.</hi> So that you may see they haue no absolute authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to enioyne any thing vnto the people which is not according to the lawe: in as muche as it is saide, according to the lawe which they shall teache thee, thou shalt do. Whiche thing yet is better explaned in <hi>Deuteronmy cap. 24. Take heede of the plague of leprosie, that you obserue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, and doe according too all that the Priestes of the Leuites shall teache thee, take heede ye doe as I commaund them.</hi> The Priestes therefore may lay no more vppon the people then they had in commaundement from the Lorde. You maye well perceiue then that before Christ, men did iudge according too the Scripture, and as they were directed by it. You are greatly deceiued therfore ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the scripture to be but a dead worde
<pb facs="tcp:176688:111"/> vntil a man come &amp; iudge of it: for it hath a certaine truth in it, from the which if any man shoulde swarue in iudgement, yet should it remaine true al y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> notwithstāding: And if any should ioine in iudgement with the true meaning of it, yet should he adde nothing to the trueth thereof, which is the life of the worde. For the worde is the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing voyce, and that which giueth life and authoritie vnto the other, euen as it falleth out in ciuil matters, that the iudges in all courtes are led by the lawe, what to thinke and pronounce of the matter that is brought before them: and if they shal geue sentence contrary to law, it shal not excuse them that they were iudges: but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, beeyng charged that they haue dealt corruptly in any sentence, this shal cleare them, yf they can truely say that they haue doone nothyng but according to law, &amp; that which the law will beare them in. You say that out of the Church, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is a lyar: in the Church, the spirite of god and not man iudgeth, who was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to lead her into al trueth. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaking to the church, saith that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is a liar, &amp; therefore no man is to
<pb facs="tcp:176688:111"/> be beleued for this cause only, because he is of the church, for the true Church is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to be the true Church, because she spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of her selfe but hath the woorde to testify of her. You remember what <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> hath saide before: <hi>Ex quo non legit haec scripta, sed a seipso loquitur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chrisost. de san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto et adorando spiritu.</note>

And she had also the same cause that they had, why she shoulde not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the vnderstanding of the Scriptures
<pb facs="tcp:176688:112"/> from them, of whom she receiued the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures thēselues. For they refused the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions and glosses of the scribes &amp; Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, albeit they receiued the Scriptures from them. She had likewise greater cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty (euē as they had,) why she should be persuaded that you had corrupt the sence &amp; meaning, rather then the worde and text it selfe, for they doubted not of the worde and text, that they receiued from the Pharisees and yet for all that reiected their expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as contrarie to the trueth of that text, which they had deliuered vnto them.</p>
               <p>To your last demaūd requiring to know whether there was euer frō the beginning an external Priesthood, &amp; whether that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Priesthood had not alwayes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal sacrifice: I answer no, referring you for profe hereof vnto the x.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> chap. of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues, wher it is thus written. <hi>Sacrifice &amp; offering, burnt offerings, and sinne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feringes thou wouldest not haue: then saide he, loe I came to doe thy will O God; he taketh away the first, that hee may establish the seconde.</hi> By the which will we are sanctified, euen by the offering
<pb facs="tcp:176688:113"/> of the bodie of Iesus Christ once made. For with one offering hath he consecrated for euer, them that are sanctified. Nowe where remission of these thinges is, there is no more offering for sinne, These be the wordes of the Apostle, Whereby you may playnely discerne, that the externall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and offering from sinne, ceassed in our Sauiour Christe, as in him, who by that one oblation made once for all, did fully discharge the sinnes of his seruauntes.</p>
